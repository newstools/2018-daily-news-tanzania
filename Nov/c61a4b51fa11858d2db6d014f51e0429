UNIVERSITY of Dodoma (Udom) has vowed to use its research finding for improved industrialisation in the country. Opening the first international conference organised by the College of Education on Innovation and Policy Reforms for Industrial Economy in Africa, Deputy Vice Chancellor (Planning, Finance and Administration), Prof Ahmed Mohamed Ame, said it was high time for Africa to use research findings wisely. He said universities were tasked to conduct research, whose findings, would be applied in a number of policy issues and decision-making, thus calling for proper utilisation of the findings. “We must play our part properly to foster the government’s industrial agenda and development issues that were research based,” said Prof Ame. He said the research findings and publications raised the status of universities, commending the college for staging the first international conference, which he said it should be used to bring about positive changes in Africa’s industrial economy. Earlier, the facility’s Director of Research and Publications, Consultancy and Institutional Collaboration, Prof Flora Fabian, said they wanted to use the research findings to improve the learning and teaching environment. “As the fifth phase government clearly focuses on industrialisation as a higher learning institution we want to research on best practices to attain the end,” she said. He added that they wanted to teach them the proper way of thinking and not how to think so that they could be innovative in the circumstances. Prof Fabian said they advocated transformative learning, whereas through information communication technology they could address a shortage of lecturers and challenges facing people with disabilities. The two-day conference has drawn participants from local higher learning institutions and international scholars from Kenya, Uganda, South Africa and the United Kingdom.
