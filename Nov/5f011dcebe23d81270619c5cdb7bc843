FOREIGN Affairs and East African Cooperation Deputy Minister, Damas Ndumbaro has challenged the Centre for Foreign Relations (CFR) to utilize its academic potential by debating on diplomatic attacks against the country. “In the ministry there is no institution with huge potential like this centre but  It hasn’t been fully utilized,” Dr Ndumbaro stated, noting that Tanzania has been severally attacked in the diplomatic arena but diplomatic experts have remained silent. He voiced the sentiments  during an impromptu visit to the facility on Tuesday during which he had opportunity to hear from the staff over their concerns.
