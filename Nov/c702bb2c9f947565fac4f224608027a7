A FRAUD and money laundering case involving two foreigners and a Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) staff has once again stalled, as the Prosecution says investigations are going on. A Portuguese Ricardo Retto (41), George Mavroudis (52) from Cyprus who are tour operators and Gasper Swai from TRA have been charged that unlawfully jointly and together transferred ownership of 41 vehicles without attaching the transfer of ownership agreement thereby evading to pay tax. The Prosecutor, Mr Innocent Njau told the Arusha Resident Magistrate Patricia Kisinda that as the investigations are incomplete they were praying for another mention date before the case is transferred to the High Court for hearing. The magistrate adjourned the matter to December 7. The trio has been arraigned on counts of conspiracy, tax evasion and money laundering in a saga that relates ownership and illegal transfer of 41 motor vehicles in Arusha and a premise at Kyameto Island plot in Musoma. Mavroudis (52), the second accused person and a resident of Corridor Areas, Arusha, a legal owner of right of occupancy of premises on Plot No. 1 'Kyameto Island' (Lukuba Island Lodge) in Musoma District, leased the said premises to Tyche Ltd of Arusha for consideration of $32,000 without paying tax.
