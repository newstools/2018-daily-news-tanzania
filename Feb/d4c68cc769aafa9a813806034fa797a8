The plant located at Madimba, Mtwara, started operation in mid third quarter of 2015, has installed processing capacity of 210 million standard cubic feet a day (mmscfd) and manned by almost 100 people. The Plant Safety Officer Deus Kiheka said since commencing operation the plant has registered “zero occupation accident” thanks to laid down safety procedures, among them periodical training and drilling before and after operation. “We have zero tolerance on safety issue since gas is highly explosive material,” Mr Kiheka told Daily News when group journalists from various media houses toured the plant. The tour was organised by Bank of Tanzania. The plant is currently processing 80mmscf a day, which is almost one-third of installed capacity since gas demand is still low. The plant Head of Operations and Maintenance, Mr Lucas Nkilila, said the gas processed is transported to Dar for power generation at Kinyerezi where 400MW is produced from Madimba’s plant. “This plant is under Gasco, [a TPDC subsidiary], overseeing gas supply. The gas processed is drawn from four wells at Mnazi Bay,” Mr Nkilila said. He said the plant is the biggest in the country with processing capacity of 210mmscfd after an investment of 197 million US dollars. The other three are two at Songo Songo—manned by Pan- Africa Energy with a capacity of 180mmscfd and another at Mnazi Bay operated by Maurel and Prom with a capacity of 100mmscfd. Recently TPDC formed two directorates and formed two new commercial subsidiaries Gas Supply Company (GASCO) and PETROTAN, which will invest in and market Tanzanian gas and oil respectively
