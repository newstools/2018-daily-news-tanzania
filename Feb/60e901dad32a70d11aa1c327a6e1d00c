The dispute, which has raged for some ten years, is the source of deep disharmony. The Rukwa Regional Commissioner, Mr Joachim Wangabo, has calmed the anxiety of the college community, saying that, he was optimistic that discussions between a government team that he would lead, and the top leaders of the diocese on March 1, this year, would yield positive results. I n addition, the RC urged the church leaders to visit the college before then, to witness the bad shape in which the institution has been, over lack of renovation spanning some 43 years. According to some reports, the late diocesan bishop, Kalolo Msakila, gave the premises to the government shortly after Rukwa Region was established in January 1974, but that the decision was done verbally and not backed by documentation. The buildings were initially converted into the regional commissioner’s base until 1989 when it moved to its newly built structures at Mkoani, which then hosted the college. The conflict features four parties the Roman Catholic Church, Sumbawanga Diocese the owner of the buildings, the education ministry that oversees the college and the Office of the Rukwa Regional Commissioner. “I have already met with the top leadership of the Roman Catholic Church, Sumbawanga Diocese and discussed the matter comprehensively …. We shall meet again on March 1, this year … I’m very optimistic the matter will be solve amicably,” Mr Wangabo said. In her welcoming remarks, the Principal for Sumbawanga Teachers’ College, Ms Witness Maeda, told the RC that the premises of the institution were in bad shape and needed immediate major renovations; that its roofing leaked a lot during rain seasons. “The Ministry of Education , Science and Technology is not willing to embark on either construction of new buildings or undertaking major renovation because the college does not have title deeds,” she said.
