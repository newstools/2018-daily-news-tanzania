Speaking during the launching of the unit and the handing over of six police dogs to the unit at KIA, the Acting Managing Director with the Kilimanjaro Airports Development Company (KADCO) Christopher Mukoma, said the move was meant to intensify security at the world’s famous international airport. “The introduction of the police dog unit as part of our security system will strengthen security here, in addition to the high-tech scanning machines which were fitted recently,” he said. He added, “This move should act as a caution signal to all smugglers that we are now well equipped as far as the security at KIA is concerned.” Mr Mukoma said that the introduction of the police dog unit at KIA was inevitable especially when put in mind that criminals do have many techniques. “This is why we always want to be ahead of them by introducing new measures to curb their illegal deeds, we have fitted high tech scanning machines, which are able to detect all goods passing at KIA to prevent illegal trafficking of goods,” he said. Inspector General of Police (IGP) Simon Sirro said plans were underway to introduce police dog units in all the airports in the country. In a statement read on his behalf by the Head of the Horse and Dog Section of the Police Force, Dr Eugine Emmanuel, IGP Sirro also said the police dog unit will be deployed in all border posts bordering Tanzania and other countries. “The decision to introduce the police dog unit at KIA is the result of major achievements recorded after establishment of police dogs units at the Julius Nyerere International Airport (JNIA),” he added. Kilimanjaro Regional Commissioner (RC) Anna Mghwira hailed KADCO and the police force for introducing the police dog unit at the airport, saying the move compliments the government’s efforts to tighten security
