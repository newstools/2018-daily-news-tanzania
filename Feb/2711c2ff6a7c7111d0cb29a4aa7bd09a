He made the pledge despite objections by some MPs during the just ended Parliament session. The legislators, some of them from LAKE Zone constituencies, charged that it was conducted unfairly, and was likely to paralyse economic activities, as most people lived off fishing. Mr Mpina emphatically declared, however, that he would soon kick start the second phase of the operation against the illegal fishing and unlawful exportation of the fish products. “When I embark on a mission, I’m determined to succeed and don’t allow fear to derail me; within one year, illegal fishing will be relegated to history,” he said. Meanwhile, he directed the Permanent Secretary of his docket, Dr Yohana Budeba to suspend 35 officials of the fisheries department, directing immediate investigations on their suspected involvement in illegal fishing. Furthermore, he instructed 26 Beach Management Units (BMUs) that were accused of facilitating the crime in Lake Victoria to be dissolved and new ones established. Mr Mpina was giving an assessment of the first phase of the exercise for this year which started in January this year, involving 265 officials from different government institutions. He used the same platform to award certificates of participation to those who participated in the first round. The minister revealed that the evaluation established serious misdeeds involving some leaders, including MPs, council chairpersons, councillors and village chairpersons sponsoring illegal fishing. Mr Mpina said 4.7bn/- had been collected during the first phase, in the form of penalties, featuring fishermen, 11 fish processing industries, three fish net factories and 16 fish net traders. Mr Mpina stated that the operation had drawn blessings from the CCM’s Manifesto and the 2003 Fishing Act.
