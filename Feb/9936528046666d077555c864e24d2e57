Prof Mdegela, who is associated with the Department of Veterinary Medicine and Public Health, made the remarks in Dar es Salaam yesterday during a project briefs working session aimed at improving research activities that are beneficial to the community. He cited South Korea as among countries that had built the capacity of their researchers, and enabled them to conduct research that help to tackle challenges and facilitate economic productivity. “It is difficult to move forward if we do not have positive results that are not in compliance with national research agenda programmes that bring about positive changes to the community,” Prof Mdegela said. “Many research activities that are taking place are typical and dependent on the prospects of donors. So it does not fulfill the needs of the people and not for sustainable agenda, which causes even good research fail to achieve the level of development productivity with accordance of current market,” he noted. He also proposed for creation of forums for drawing researchers and factory owners together, focused on determining how researchers can play complimentary roles in production processes. For his part, the Director of Physical Science from the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology, Prof Mohammed Sheikh, said South Korea’s private sector invested more than 80 per cent in research, but in Tanzania it was unclear how the contribution of the private sector to research was. He said that main aim of the meeting was to explore means of simplifying the language of researchers, to make it easily comprehensible to community members
