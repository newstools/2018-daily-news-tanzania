In the new initiative, the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development has engaged IGN FI (The French National Institute of Geographical and Forestry Information) to implement a pilot project to design, supply, install and commission an Integrated Land Management Information System (ILMIS). Funded by the World Bank, the project is expected to help ease the management of Tanzanian land, while facilitating access to information for populations. Shaban Pazi, the Acting Director of ICT in the Ministry of Land, Housing and Human Settlements Development said that the objective of the initiative is to strengthen land tenure security, by improving the security and reliability of land transactions with the establishment of an efficient and reliable land information system. “Implemented in the Dar es Salaam Zone Office and the Kinondoni Municipal Council, the project will fully integrate land administration, registration and surveying, and support the process of transforming land records and maps into digital formats,” he said. He added that the new efficient and reliable land information system, established by the project, will increase land tenure security, provide affordable, secure and reliable land administration services to customers, and reduce the time required to check, update and transfer land. The ministry official said the new system will also prevent encroachment on wetlands, forests, road reserves and other public land, and at the same time help to reduce corruption associated with checks, registration and transfer of title deeds, which will improve public confidence in the land administration system. He further said that the new process will automatically stop double allocation of land and in the process strongly reduce the number of land disputes which are constantly reported in the country. The IGN FI Deputy Project Manager, Carol Roffer said that the current land registration system is too slow and outdated, which is a long process. She said that the system being used at the moment makes it difficult to assess validity of customers’ certificates and consumes a lot of time, but still creates gaps for forgery of the same land certificates
