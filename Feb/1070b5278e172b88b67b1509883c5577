Speaking in Dar es Salaam today (Wednesday), the bank’s Executive Director, Dr Charles Kimei, said the credit card has two platforms, namely, TemboCard World Rewards and TemboCard Gold Credit card. “These cards are different from the existing Debit Card which allows the customer to pay for various services regarding to the status of his or her savings. Generally, the credit cards enable customers to buy now and pay later (Buy now, pay later),” Dr Kimei said. He added that the newly introduced cards in the country will empower customers to purchase more than their savings. He added that the TemboCard Gold Credit Card enables a customer to get loans of up to 30m/- and would have 45 days to pay, while TemboCard Credit Card owners who will be able to get loans of up 50m/- are entitled to get 30 per cent in cash while the 70 per cent will be spent through online payment.
