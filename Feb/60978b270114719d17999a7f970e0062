Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, Deputy Minister Faustine Ndugulile noted in the Parliament yesterday that the ministry is reviewing the current policy for harmonising it. He informed the House on this development when reacting to Special Seats MP Susan Lyimo (CHADEMA) who noted with concern the poor services rendered to elderly people. “What would the government tell elderly people who participated during liberation of the nation over improving their services,” she asked, citing Bukumbi in Mwanza as one of the examples of the elders’ camps with poor services and infrastructure. Dr Ndugulile said the government was aware that the infrastructure of the elders’ camps in the country needed improvement. He assured the MP that the ministry would this year allocate funds from its budget for repairing Bukumbi camp. So far, the government has spent 285m/- on construction of the camps at Kolandoto in Shinyanga, Kilima in Kagera and constructing a fence for Njoro camp in Kilimanjaro region. He further said the government values the contribution that the elderly people had given during the struggle for independence. “The Fifth Phase Government assures all elders who live in the camps and those outside the camps that it intends to improve their services,” he said. One of the mechanisms to success was to introduce subsection to serve elderly people at the community development departme
