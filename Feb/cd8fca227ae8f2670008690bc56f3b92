So far, 76 per cent of people in Kinondoni District enjoy clean and safe water supply from Dawasco. Deputy Minister for Water and Irrigation, Jumaa Aweso, asked Kinondoni Municipal Council to work closely with Dawasa and Dawasco, to ensure they cover the remaining 19 per cent to reach the government’s target of 95 per cent of water supply in urban areas. The Deputy Minister who was impressed by efforts by the municipality and Dawasa’s performance, said his ministry will not be an obstacle to the district’s projects. However, he warned against entering into agreements with contractors who are incapable of executing their duties as required. Dawasa’s Acting Director for Maintenance and Services, Modester Mushi, said that in ensuring Kinondoni District and other areas of Dar es Salaam have access to safe and clean water, Dawasa is implementing various projects.
