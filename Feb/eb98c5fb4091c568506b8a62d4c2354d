Thereafter, Dodoma regional authorities indefinitely suspended the sales or donation of unauthorised plots, defending the motive as protecting the new designated capital from unplanned settlements which had engulfed dozen of towns and cities. But speaking to the ‘Daily News’ here yesterday, Dodoma Municipal Director Godwin Kunambi said the new authority is now putting at least 15,000 plots for sale from next month. “… We’ll start next March ... we’ll remain open as long as we have the plots,” he said, adding that the municipal council was committed to map and survey at least 45,000 plots every year. According to Kunambi, the new plots will also include cheap plots for ordinary Tanzanian to afford. But “we will also have a high price on some locations that are only designed for building storey structures.” An initial price quoted by the authority will be 2,500/- per square. This means a 600msq plot will cost at least 1,500,000/-. “… everyone should keep calm … the authorities are still under a period of transformation … but we remain committed to improving public service,” he insisted. Apparently, Dodoma Regional Commissioner (RC), Dr Binilith Mahenge announced an endless campaign seeking to pull down all structures built without legal permits in the municipal. The regional chief says he want to make Dodoma the deserving capital city, a well planned that follows the city master plan. “We’re not going to leave any stone unturned,” he said recently, instructing authorities to conduct regular surveillance against ‘disobedient’ investors setting up structures without authority’s approval. Since its existence, the Capital Development Authority -CDA which was dissolved by President John Magufuli had only mapped and surveyed 65,000 plots. The number of plots was however not enough to meet the demands especially after the government announced to relocate its administration from the port city of Dar es Salaam to Dodoma
