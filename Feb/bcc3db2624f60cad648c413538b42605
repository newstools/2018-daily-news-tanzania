Launched in 2005 and now spanning more than 30 countries, the Citi Micro-entrepreneurship Awards highlight the contributions of micro-entrepreneurs and microfinance institutions (MFIs) to their local economies. Through the programme, the Citi Foundation has invested more than 21m US dollars in microfinance networks and MFIs around the world, convening thousands of key stakeholders that influence sectorwide policy and regulation and encourage innovation around the world. Citibank has partnered with Tanzania Association of Microfinance Institutions (TAMFI) to manage the awards, where over 70million Tanzania Shillings will be awarded to 16 winners. Last year, the CMA was a remarkable event which recognised and awarded 16 Micro entrepreneurs selected by Microfinance Institutions. The winners who exhibited excellence in areas such as loan repayment, business growth, employment growth, and impact on the community took home cash and non-cash prizes. Speaking at the launch, Winnie Terry, TAMFI’s Chief Executive Officer said “The awards will go a long way to highlight the achievements of some of the most innovative micro-entrepreneurs.” “As we look to creating opportunities and widening pathways for micro-entrepreneurs including women and youth in Tanzania, these awards will provide the much needed highlight on the significant contribution that micro and small businesses are bringing to the economy”. “In today’s Tanzania, the government is championing industrialisation. Micro-entrepreneurs and microfinance institutions are capable of playing a big role, initially in establishment of cottage industries, which later can grow into mainstream factories,” Citibank CEO Joseph Carasso sai
