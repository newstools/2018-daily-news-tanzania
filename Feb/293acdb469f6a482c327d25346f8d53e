Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of UCSAF, Engineer Peter Ulanga, noted here yesterday that the system would allow health service providers to evaluate,diagnose and treat patients without the need for a person visit. “We’ve managed to connect 14 public health facilities with the telemedicine service in pilot project which began in 2013,” said the UCSAF boss during a stakeholders’ engagement meeting on Tanzania Telemedicine Design and Implementation. Telemedicine is the remote delivery of healthcare services, such as health assessments or consultations over the telecommunications infrastructure. Eng. Ulanga said UCSAF will finance installation of telecommunication infrastructure in the hospitals, adding that the Fund will team up with a telecom firm, Halotel Tanzania to provide internet service to the hospitals connected with telemedicine service. On his part, Permanent Secretary (PS)in the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender and Children, Dr Mpoki Ulisubisya, said there were a number of telemedicine initiatives underway with the objective of providing quality consultation and caring for patients in remote areas. “Although the current initiatives remain inadequate and unsustainable, interest and activity appear to be growing in most parts of the country in the provision of medical consultation from a distance through video conferencing along with exchange of medical records online,” he said. Dr Ulisubisya pointed out some of the notable telemedicine initiatives as linking Bugando, KCMC, Mbeya, Amana, Mwananyamala, Tumbi, Bagamoyo hospitals and Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH). However, he said the project encountered with a number of challenges including obsolete telemedicine equipment and that the plan now is to replace them with the latest technology through generous support of UCSAF. Dr Ulisubisya said further the government was working on pressing issues associated with the health sector, pointing out the issues as shortage of qualified healthcare professionals at all levels of health system
