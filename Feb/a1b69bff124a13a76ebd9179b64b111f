The deputy minister for Works, Transport and Communication, Eng Atashasta Nditiye said at the weekend that the residents would be relocated to Msongola Ward within the city. He clarified that the government had set aside 20bn/- to compensate an estimated 1,186 people whose areas have been taken for the project. He was speaking to some residents on vacating list when he explained that, 59 residents out of 1,186 have voluntarily relocated and benefited with 1.27bn/- compensation. About 326 residents (out of 1,186) filed the case at the Court. The government therefore was in search of plots for 801 people with 537 being the first batch, while waiting for the Court’s judgment. However, the residents expressed their dissatisfaction, saying there was no valuation which took place in 2013 as per the Deputy’s statement. The last one was in 1997, which is outdated and cannot favour them in anyway. Eng Nditiye took an opportunity to remind them that: “It was in 1950s when official announced that Kipunguni belongs to the Airport, meaning that most residents there were invaders. However, the government couldn’t abandon you, that is why we re compensating you.” Kipunguni Local government Chairman, Mr Mwinyijuma Seke complained that there were residents who were not involved in the said 2013 valuation exercise wherein the Deputy Minister directed him to present the names to Tanzania Airports Authority (TAA), for consideration. Eng Nditiye insisted that nobody will be left behind and that the available plots are to be distributed any time after the relevant District Commissioner (Ilala) in presence of TAA personnel has confirmed the receipt, from the assigned contractor (for plots search) Tanzania Remix Company. TAA Acting Director General, Mr Richard Mayongela declared that “… this business will be over within this week. There is a possibility of people’s relocation in the next week.”
