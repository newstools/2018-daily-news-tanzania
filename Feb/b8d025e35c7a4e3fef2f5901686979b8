Handing over the donation on behalf of the President, Tanga Regional Commissioner (RC), Martine Shigella, said the Head of State has fulfilled his August 2017 pledge to Hoza villagers. He said the villagers stopped the Head of State’s motorcade holding placards that showed various challenges facing them. The residents told Dr Magufuli that they were travelling long distance to seek medical treatment due to the lack of laboratory in their areas. “The President promised 10m/- to Komkonga village to improve health services after villagers told him their problems when he was on his way to Tanga where he was scheduled to lay the foundation stone for Hoima-Tanga crude oil pipeline,” he said. Handeni District Medical Officer (DMO), Dr Credianus Mgimba, confirmed to have received the money from Tanga Regional Commissioner’s office and deposited it into the dispensary bank account. He said the equipment have been ordered from medical store department (MSD). He mentioned the equipment as microscope, typhoid sampling test machine, urinalysis sampling machine, diabetic testing machine and hemoglobin detecting machine. He said all equipment cost 5,296,300/-, with 4,730,070/- procuring spare parts. Handeni District Council Executive Director, William Mafukwe, said the laboratory will soon start operations and that at least 15,000 people are expected to benefit. Handeni District Commissioner (DC), Godwin Gondwe, thanked the President for fulfilling his promise.
