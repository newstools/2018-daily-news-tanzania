NEMC oversees preparation of the report that covers Mainland Tanzania’s coastal area. The area is said to host around 25 per cent of the Mainland’s population. Besides, other aspects the report highlights include opportunities available to and for the people to seize and benefit from. Officiating at the launch of Pwani Environmental Group yesterday, Acting NEMC Director General, Dr Vedast Makota, said the council has registered 557 expert assessors and 357 inspectors of environment to help the council in overseeing conservation and protection of environment. Also, 74 companies have been enrolled for inspection of environment. Dr Makota appealed to Tanzanians to conserve the environment to make prospective industrial investors behave and preserve surroundings. “If you protect the environment, potential investors in industries will avoid things likely to damage it. We also ask you to register your projects so that environment assessment can be done with ease,” he said. He added that the council is working to eliminate challenges related to protection and conservation of the environment because, he said, successful establishment of industries largely depends on safe environment. The Pwani Environment Group Patron, Ms Josephine Mzimba, said the group’s ambition is to be Dar es Salaam’s exemplary group in protecting the environment. The group members endorsed a mandatory 5,000/- monthly contribution and Ms Mzimba said Tegeta families will also be mobilised to contribute the same amount in order to start a savings and credit cooperative society, besides protecting the environment. Mr Hawana Nandwea said the group has radically changed Tegeta’s surroundings because it has committed members. “This place was hazardous and residents were vulnerable to contracting infectious diseases. The situation has changed completely,” he said.
