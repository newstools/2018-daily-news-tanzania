The company, under Hansa Group, has been the Fuso’s partner for over 30 years, making it the second longest standing general distributor for Mitsubishi Fuso trucks in East Africa. Fuso has sold many commercial vehicles in Tanzania since its inception in the year 1985 in Tanzania. The company’s general manager Laurian Martin said they have already started procedures to establish the centres along the Dar es Salaam-Iringa-Mbeya-Lubumbashi (Highway). “We have seen this as one of measures to support the government in reducing accidents caused by condition of the vehicles,” he said. He stated this when launching a new brand of TV 3340S heavy duty Fuso truck in Dar es Salaam over the weekend. “This extremely robust tractor model has been added to our already wide product range in response to the demand for heavyduty trucks,” he said, adding: “With this model in the Tanzanian market, our customers will have a wider choice of products to effectively cater to their needs in transport.” He said the launch now puts the company into centre stage saying that they now have the full lineup. Commercial Vehicle demand has been increasing due to economic growth of Tanzania which has remained at around 7 per cent for over the decade. Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation (MFTBC), is one of Asia’s leading commercial vehicle manufacturers, under the umbrella of Daimler Trucks Asia. Mr Rupin Rajani, Chairman of the Hansa Group said: “We are delighted to launch the TV model in Tanzania and we are convinced that this truck will satisfy the various needs of our market and will prove to be a winner in this competitive market.”
