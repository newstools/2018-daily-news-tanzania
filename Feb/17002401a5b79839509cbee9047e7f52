People from all corners of life, led by President John Magufuli expressed their sadness over the demise of such a great number of young souls, children who were the future workforce of the country. This reaction of anger and sadness was felt throughout the country and beyond because the Tanzanian media made sure that everyone felt the weight of the loss, and it brought memories of an article a friend of mine wrote some years back, with the heading ‘the smallest coffins are the heaviest to carry’. However, it is sad to realize that the media is not directing its strength on a similar scenario but with a different perspective, which if properly highlighted, the country will be in constant mourning from January to December. Imagine waking up every day and being faced with the glaring headline that a plane carrying more than 250 toddlers crashed somewhere in the mountains of Tanzania, and all of them perished…….not just on a single day, but every day. According to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), every day 270 children under five years die from mostly preventable causes, which include malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea. For a sensitive country, this figure is staggering from any perspective, which means that every other day 270 homesteads are carrying small coffins for burial, coffins of children who have not yet tasted the real meaning of life. Which also means that these children (2,700 who die in ten days to be exact), can be saved if the government puts in place simple and affordable quality health services which can be accessed by every mother and her new born. These deaths, according to UNICEF, can be prevented with access to well-trained midwives, along with proven solutions like clean water, disinfectants and good nutrition. At the same time the media is supposed to play its part and focus great attention to the fate of this future generation which much can be done to save.
