“… already we have reports linked to the use of ‘personal lubricants’ or K-Y jelly (sexual oil) … and some of the victims have been hurt,” says a press statement from Tanzania Media Women Association (TAMWA)- Zanzibar. The release signed by the Isles Tamwa director, Dr Mzuri Issa, strongly appeals to regulatory authorities to ensure that such lubricants and sedative substances were strictly controlled and should not by any chance reach children. The activists say that recent reports abuse indicate that children were being raped or defiled without protection. The report further says, “ … some of these children were found unconscious … after they were sprayed with unknown chemicals … only to regain consciousness when the ill acts of rape and defilements are over. ” TAMWA says the substances were ‘easily accessible’ and that the regional commissioner for Unguja Urban West, Mr Ayoub Mohamed Mahmoud was working on “a tip” of its source.
