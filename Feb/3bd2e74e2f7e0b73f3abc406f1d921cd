The Headmaster allegedly slapped, punched and kicked Mr Mbemba while students and members of the teaching staff watched with embarrassment. The Acting DED, Mr Kwangula, told the ‘Daily News’ over the phone that before forming such a probe team he will first dispatch a team of education officials from Nkasi District Education Department to the school to find out what exactly happened. “Education Officers from my office will go to the school and meet with teaching staff, students and Mr Mbemba to find out the truth. Their advice will shed light on the matter and whether I should form a probe team or not. These officials will go to the school later this week” said the acting DED. According to Mr Kwangula, if the headmaster proves to have been committed the atrocity, his case will be forwarded to other relevant authorities including the Tanzania Service Commission (TSC) in Nkasi District for further determination. Earlier Tanzania Teachers Union (TTU) Nkasi District Secretary, Mr Hery Mtovano told this newspaper that his association strongly condemns the indiscipline shown by the school head and urged the acting Nkasi DED, Mr Kwangula to demote him with immediate effect. Narrating the incident, Mr Mtovano said on that material morning of February 15, this year, Mr Mbemba asked his school head to write an official letter authorising him to go with his students on a study tour along the beach of Lake Tanganyika
