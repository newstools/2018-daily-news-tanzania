Deputy Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism, Mr Joseph Haonga, promised Parliament yesterday that he got the advice from Rombo Mp Joseph Selasini (CHADEMA) and would work on it. However, he quickly mentioned that the government allocates between five and seven per cent of revenue from the visiting tourists to fund development projects designed by the councils in those areas. Mr Selasini, said he was wondering why the villages surrounding the mountain were not given the royalties in return for participating in activities of protecting the tallest mountain. “The villagers have always been responding to putting off the fires occurring at the mountain. Why are they not given royalties from tourist revenue as incentives,” he queried. Mr Selasini was posing a supplementary question after asking a basic question on behalf of Vunjo Mp James Mbatia (NCCRMageuzi). Mr Mbatia wanted to know the total amount the country earned from Kilimanjaro Mountain through tourism activities in the past ten years. He further asked what percentage of the collected revenue was spent on setting up infrastructure to sustain the mountain. When answering the question, Mr Haonga explained that the total revenue collected from the Kilimanjaro mountain tourism activities between 2007/8 and 2016/17 was 471.5bn/-. Out of it, 67.5bn/- was spent on building infrastructure to maintain the mountain whereby 20.8bn/- was allocated to development projects and the remaining 46.6bn/- was channelled to running the tourist attraction. Mr Hasunga noted that the surrounding villages benefited from the 2.2bn/- which was spent on developing social development projects as part of the corporate social responsibility.
