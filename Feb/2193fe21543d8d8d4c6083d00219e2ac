Speaking in Dar es Salaam yesterday, Lesotho’s Minister for Public Works and Transport, Mr Lehlohonolo Moramotse said DART is a good system of public transport that is helping in solving the challenge of traffic jams and saves time. He made the remarks when the delegation visited the DART project, during a five-day study tour on output and performance-based contracting for road rehabilitation and maintenance. According to him, the challenge of traffic jams in the Kingdom of Lesotho is still large due to unfriendly road infrastructure and there is no good system of public transport, so the rapid bus project would be a good solution for the challenges. “We have studied different good things Tanzania is doing to solve transport challenges; we will go and implement it in Lesotho… but a great challenge we discovered in Tanzania is area for car parking, a thing which we will consider when improving our road infrastructure,” he said. The DART Chief Executive Officer, Leonard Rwakatale, said that through the study tour by the people of Lesotho, he has learnt that Tanzania is doing well in implementing various development projects that impress other countries. “I also learnt that we have the same challenges of transport system with Lesotho but as a country, we have made a great move in improving it through various projects of regional and national roads,” Rwakatale said. After visiting DART projects in Ubungo and Gerezani area at Kariakoo, the delegates toured the undergoing flyover construction project at Tazara area. Speaking to the delegates, the Project Engineer, Manger Rajab said the project is now 78 per cent complete and by October this year, the project of 35 months will be complete and start operating
