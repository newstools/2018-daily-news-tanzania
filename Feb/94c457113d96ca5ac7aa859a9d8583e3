Community health workers engaged in supporting people living with Aids (PLWAs) told the ‘Daily News’ yesterday that the government, in collaboration with development partners in supporting HIVAIDS initiatives, need to come up with new strategies to save the young population from infections. About 47 community health workers from seven districts in the region are attending a week-long workshop which target to empower them with new skills in providing psycho-support, in assisting pregnant and lactating women, children and adolescent girls and young women on Ant-Retro Viral Treatment (ARV). According to Ms Sesilia Yona, a Programme Officer from the Ariel Glaser Pediatric Aids Healthcare Initiative (AGPAHI) responsible for Community Linkages, more strategies were crucial today in supporting the community from the new HIV prevalence. “AGPAHI has responded positively by organising this workshop where 47 Community Health Workers will be comprehensively trained on new approaches and counseling skills, as the organisation is set to scale up such trainings in the coming three years,” she said. During the commemorations of the International Aids Day, last year, it was disclosed of drastic increase in new HIV infections from 4.8 to 7 per cent for Mwanza region which calls for immediate interventional measures. One of the workshop trainers and retired Nursing Officer, Mr Gaston Kapungu, said there were many factors attracting new infections ranging from stigma, self stigma to naming and shaming among newly infected people. He said that studies have shown that many people still shy away from declaring their HIV status hence spreading infections without being easily noticed. Another problem was that many patients hesitate to declare their status for fear of being excommunicated socially or being named as prostitutes, sexual workers and unfaithful in marriages. “We are insisting for patients to be open over their health status so that in doing so, the government and partners like AGPAHI and others can reach and provide them with the needed support including care, counseling and treatment,” he said
