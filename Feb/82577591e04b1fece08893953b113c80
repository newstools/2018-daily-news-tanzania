Etihad Airways Country Manager Tanzania, Allen Okoromu, said the new offer would help to ease travelling costs and enable travellers to discover the Emirate and its rich cultural experiences. “February is the perfect time to visit Abu Dhabi. The weather is glorious which makes it great for exploring the city’s outdoor and indoor attractions or experiencing the famous Arabic hospitality,” he said. “Etihad’s objective is to subsidise travel expenses for Tanzanian travellers to enable more people to experience the UAE.” According to him, Etihad Airways flights from Tanzania are operated by a two-class Airbus A320, with 16 Business Class seats and 120 in Economy Class and travellers to Abu Dhabi from Dar es Salaam on Etihad Airways “will experience the airline’s awardwinning service by multinational cabin crew and on-board nannies, extensive inflight entertainment selections and a choice of complimentary international meals and beverages.”
