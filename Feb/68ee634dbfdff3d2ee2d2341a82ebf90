The London-listed gold miner said it had purchased 120,000 ounce of gold put options at a price of $1,320 per troy ounce. The contracts will expire in instalments of 30,000 ounces every month between March and June, giving the company the option to sell the gold at that fixed price. The options allow Acacia to hedge against a fall in gold prices as it plans to restart exports in Tanzania following an initial deal brokered by its majority owner Barrick Gold and President John Magufuli last October. Barrick is still working out final details of the deal for Acacia, which could allow it to restart exports this year. Acacia has been unable to export gold from Tanzania since March and has put its largest mine in the country on care and maintenance. It is the second purchase of gold put options by Acacia in less than six months. Last September Acacia bought 210,000 of gold options at a price of $1,300 a troy ounce.
