Acting Director General of Information and Communication Commission, Samson Mwela, said in Dar es Salaam yesterday that ICT uses have increased so fast that the economy depends on it. Mr Mwela, briefing reporters on the first cyber security Tanzania (CYBERTZ) Forum, slated for today at Kilimanjaro Hall of the Central Bank of Tanzania Building, said ICT has a critical role in wealth creation and improving socio-economic well-being of the citizens. “ICT has become part and parcel of human life, bringing about challenges as well as opportunities ... it’s vital that people make good use of it to avoid harm in the society,” said Mr Mwela. Challenges and opportunities, he said, led to the establishment of the National Information and Communication Technology Policy of 2016. Mr Mwela pointed out that since the policy came into force in 2016, the commission deemed it fit to convene the forum that will bring together experts to discuss gaps, challenges and areas that require amendments. He said the forum aims at creating good environment for use of ICT in the country. He cited an example of mobile money which has gained fame in the country, saying the gaps, challenges and solutions on its operations can only be identified within the country settings. “The introduction of mobile money services has enabled people to save, send and spend money including payment of bills for utilities through mobile systems in the country,” he said. He noted that Tanzanians do not expect people from United Kingdom who do not have a similar service, “to help us solve the challenges we encounter.” Areas which will be looked on include partnerships between policy makers and implementers to scrutinise on areas that require attention. Others are technology and competency, research, legal, regulatory and enforcement. The forum will draw its participants from researchers, university lecturers, experts from Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology, internet and mobile networks
