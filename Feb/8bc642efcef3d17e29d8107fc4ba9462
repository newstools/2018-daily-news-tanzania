Minerals Deputy Minister Dotto Biteko, told them that the government was working on the procedures to revive the coal mine, as well as arranging payments of former employees. “All former employees with the Kiwira Coal Mine will be paid their dues and the government is currently assessing and ascertaining the debts before issuing payments,” he told them. He added, “We inherited the debts from the former investors of the coal mine, but I assure you that all will be paid.” He said currently some legal procedures were progressing since the coal mine is one of the priority projects for implementation. He directed the man-agement of the coal mine to ensure that the surrounding communities are closely engaged in the ongoing activities including cleanness and rehabilitation. Mr Biteko assured the communities close to the coal mine that once the legal procedures were complete and reopening will be the first beneficiaries in areas of employments and social services. The Deputy Minister was touring and inspecting the Kiwira and Kabulo coal mines under the State Mining Corporation (STAMICO). He was made to respond to people’s questions concerning the fate of the coal mines that its closure had denied them immense opportunities and benefits. They told Mr Biteko that some services like clean and safe water were currently missing following closure of the coal mine. In 2008 the government decided to re-own the Kiwira Coal Mine that was expected to generate over 200 Megawatts. In 2013 the government handed over STAMICO with the mandate to re-develop the mine and power generation.
