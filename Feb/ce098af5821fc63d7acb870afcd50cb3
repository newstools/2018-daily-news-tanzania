Tarime Town Council Director Mr Elias Ntirihungwa had shut down large business which have not been paying service levy. The exercise targeted several filling stations, hotels, hardware stores, bars and restaurants and some financial institutions. Few hours after the exercise, several owners of the closed businesses surrendered themselves to the council director’s office for payment. “After closing their business they are flocking to make payments. They have responded to what we want. We want them to pay service levy to boost our efforts in improving social services in Tarime town council,” the Tarime Town Council Director told reporters shortly after the operation. He said the goal was to collect around 250m/- from targeted businesses and that the money would be invested on development activities with provision of social services getting top priority. Service levy is a legal requirement that compels business owners to pay 0.3 per cent of their turnover to the host councils.
