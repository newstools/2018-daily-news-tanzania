Energy Minister, Dr Medard Kalemani said the investment decision awaits completion of an environment impact assessment report from the National Environment Management Council (NEMC) and the Tanzania Wildlife Authority (TAWA). “We expect the drilling work to start anytime from September, 2018,” he said, noting that the contract to that effect between the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) and the investor was signed since February 2012. The Energy Minister highlighted that a hydrocarbon exploration had indicated that the basin has possible reserves of between 180 million and 500 million barrels. He refuted reports that the contract leading to the investment and subsequently drilling of the oil had not been signed and officers at the state-owned corporation TPDC were holding back the documents. Earlier in a supplementary question, Malinyi MP (CCM), Dr Hadji Mponda accused TPDC for delaying to sign the contract that would openHe said the drilling work was supposed to have been commissioned since 2016, but the state authorities have been playing a ‘cat and mouse game.’’ “My people in Malinyi want to know the timeframe as to when the project will kickoff,” he asked, adding whether the government has made sufficient efforts to prepare ‘wananchi’ to grab the new opportunities. Dr Kalemani said the Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) was signed in 2012 and the investment will be at Ipera Village in the Kilombero basin, Morogoro Region. He said the government under TPDC has frequently been holding public awareness campaigns to the ‘wananchi’ surrounding the investment site and that more campaigns will be launched through local radio station and newspapers.
