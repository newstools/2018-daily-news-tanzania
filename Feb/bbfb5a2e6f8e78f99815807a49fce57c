Addressing officers and citizens who turned out to witness the handing over event, Dr Magufuli thanked PLA and the Chinese government for enabling the construction of the military centre, adding that the Tanzanian government was highly appreciating the efforts by the Chinese government to support TPDF. “China and Tanzania continue to enjoy friendship and cooperation because apart from putting up this centre, China has offered its support on the construction of the Ngerengere airforce training centre in the Morogoro Region and other development projects,’’ he said asking the Chinese ambassador to present the appreciation to the Chinese President Xi Jinping. In their remarks, Ms Ke and Mr Jian said the new centre was a testimony of diplomatic ties between the two countries and congratulated TPDF for getting a centre which they believe will strengthen defence and security between Tanzania and other African countries
