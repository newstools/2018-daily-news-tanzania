The 22-year old first year student who was at the National Institute of Transport (NIT) was shot dead on February 16, this year, in a commuter bus that passed through where the police were attempting to halt demonstrations by the opposition Chama Cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo (Chadema) ahead of Kinondoni by-election last Saturday. Permanent Secretary (PS) in the Ministry of Education, Science, Technology and Vocational Training Leonard Akwilapo, said after reviewing the budget, the government has agreed to finance all the items, but through provision of materials, not cash. On Tuesday, the deceased family presented an 80m/- budget to the government, with the family spokesman Festo Kavishe explaining that it was a tentative budget, which was subject to review by both the family and government. Dr Akwilapo told the ‘Daily News’ that the budget review session involved the government and Dar es Salaam-based Rombo elders who are familiar with burial rituals in Rombo District, Kilimanjaro region. “The budget was excessively high but we have already settled with the family ... the government has been supporting the family and will sustain its support until the burial,” he said. The statement released by the ministry yesterday reiterated that the government will be responsible only on important burial requirements, arguing that some items in the proposed budget were not identified in the legal procedures. Last respects for the deceased body are set to be paid today at the College’s premises while the body will be laid to rest tomorrow in her home village, Mashati-Olele, Rombo District. President John Magufuli has already ordered quick probe by relevant state organs and legal measures against the perpetrators. He also sent condolence greetings to the deceased’s family, relatives, NIT community and the general public.
