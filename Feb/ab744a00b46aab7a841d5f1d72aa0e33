Speaking over the weekend at a function to celebrate the throughput milestone, TICTS Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Jared Zerbe unveiled that the achievement was mainly due to significant growth in imports and exports to and from Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Rwanda, Uganda and Zambia. “We thank all of our customers and stakeholders for their trust in us and assure them of our full support going forward backed by modern container handling equipment, our operations team strives to provide high quality service to all of our customers,” said Zerbe. And the firm has promised to continue to invest in equipment, staff training, and systems while further improving their customers’ service and billing capabilities as they are soon looking forward to be the first terminal in East Africa to offer true electronic delivery orders. According to Zerbe in the first year of operations in 2000, TICTS handled only 123,047 TEU, less than one-quarter of 2017’s record-breaking number. Mr Zerbe said TICTS has successfully recorded achievement due to its decision to set up a regional office in Rwanda to carry out marketing activities in landlocked countries. He said the idea has helped TICTS to capture more market in the region. He added that the significant increases in the prices of copper and other commodities, combined with the removal of VAT on transit cargos for ancillary services, have all together spurred regional economic growth and materials shipments and lead to a 35 percent increase in transit cargo to and from Dar es Salaam over last year. According to TICTS, the company has focused intensely on growing of transit cargo, developing strategies that solidify the status of TICTS, Dar Port, and connecting transport corridors, which is the most competitive means to trade with the East African interior, The TICTS boss added that his company has requested permission from Tanzania Port Authority (TPA) to increase its space either within the port or be allowed to rent or buy more land nearby the port in order to fast track cargo offloading and uploading therefore increase economic performance.
