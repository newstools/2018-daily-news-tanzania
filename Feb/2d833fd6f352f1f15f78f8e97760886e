Eng Mkaka added, “This good condition is based on installations of new electricity supply infrastructures which managed to address challenges which affected power supplies within the region in the past”. Commenting on the challenges facing the power utility in the region, Eng Mkaka said they included that of some of the clients whom he said owed the company millions of shillings.
