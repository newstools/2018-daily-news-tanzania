In a televised statement he said he was quitting with immediate effect but said he disagreed with his ANC party's decision. Earlier yesterday, the ANC told him to step down or face a vote of no confidence in parliament. The 75-year-old Zuma has been facing calls to give way to Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC's newly elected leader. Mr Zuma, who has been in power since 2009, faces numerous allegations of corruption. According to BBC, he began his speech by laughing and joking with members of the press, asking them why they looked so serious. "No life should be lost in my name and also the ANC should never be divided in my name. I have therefore come to the decision to resign as president of the republic with immediate effect," he was quoted by the BBC. "Even though I disagree with the decision of the leadership of my organisation, I have always been a disciplined member of the ANC. "As I leave I will continue to serve the people of South Africa as well as the ANC, the organisation I have served... all of my life," Mr Zuma was quoted.
