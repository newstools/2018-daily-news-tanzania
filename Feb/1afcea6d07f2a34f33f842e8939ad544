The Deputy Minister for State, President’s Office, Constitution, Legal Affairs, Public Service and Good Governance, Mr Khamis Juma Mwalim made the stance when reacting to queries from concerned lawmakers. Death penalty has not been executed in Zanzibar since obtaining her independence in 1964, according to accounts by a section of legislators. And, the backbenchers wondered why the government should keep the apparently unenforceable capital punishment and urged it to reexamine the penalty and its execution. “Since the (death) penalty seems in-executable here in Zanzibar, doesn’t the government see it’s high time to change this penalty?” queried Mr Machano Othmani Said (Mfenesini Representative). T he Deputy Minister said the Criminal Procedure Act No 7 of 2004 makes provision for the death penalty and the fact that no death penalty has been authorised many years doesn’t imply that the time has come for it to be outlawed. “The presence of a law (theory) is one thing and the execution of it (practice) is another thing,” he argued, adding that the existence of the legal death penalty was sending a message to the public not to commit any offence of that nature. He said the implementation of the death penalty was a crosscutting issue, touching different authorities. He explained that the penalty cannot be executed until the President authorises the sentence. “Death penalty is a legal sentence and the government still doesn’t see the need to change it even if it hasn’t been enforced for a long period,” Mr Mwalim said. In recent times, there has been an outcry by human rights activists to abolish on grounds that it is against the fundamental right - the right to live. Some of Representatives, however, supported the penalty. “I congratulate the government for maintaining this penalty, even the religion says whoever kills deliberately should be killed as well,” commented Shaurimoyo lawmaker, Mr Hamza Hassan Juma.
