It is also the day when residents of eight wards will get the chance to elect their councillors. The Chairman of the National Electoral Commission (NEC), Judge (retired) Semistocles Kaijage has congratulated all political parties that have fielded candidates to participate in the by-elections. The NEC Chairman also hailed political parties for maintaining peace during campaigns, asking them to uphold the same spirit today during the casting of ballot, tallying of votes and the proclamation of results. The wards where the by-elections are being held are: Isamilo in Mwanza City, Madanga in Pangani District Council, Donyomuruak, Gararagua and Kashashi in Siha District Council, Buhangaza in Muleba District Council, Mitunduruni in Singida District Council and Kanyelele in Musungwi District Council. According to the chairman of the national electoral body, a total of 355,131 voters are registered to vote in both the parliamentary byelection and councillorship polls. A total of 867 polling stations, according to NEC, will be used in the voting process. The polling stations where voters will cast their ballots are the same stations used in the voting process in the 2015 general election with some minor adjustments. The polling stations will be opened at 7am and closed at 6 pm, but the voting process will continue if voters will still be in queues at closing time. Voters whose names will appear in the Voter’s Register within the same constituency or ward are the ones who will qualify to cast ballots. The by-election in Kinondoni Constituency is being held after its former MP, Mr Maulid Mtulia defected to CCM from Civic United Front (CUF). He is today seeking re-election on CCM ticket. In Siha, its MP Mr Godwin Mollel ditched his Chadema party to join CCM last December. He is also seeking re-election on the ruling party’s ticket.
