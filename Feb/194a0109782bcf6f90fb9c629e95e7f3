The MP for Geita Rural (CCM) says the male officers in the area were arresting female suspects, contrary to human right guidelines and governing laws. “Human rights are not observed in villages. It’s unfair to see our wives being inspected by male officers,” he said, urging the government to address the situation in the district, which has only two police stations. In his response, the Deputy Minister of Home Affairs, Engineer Hamad Masauni, said: “It is a critical issue that the Police Force will address.” He explained that the government had embarked on a comprehensive strategy for addressing challenges facing police units across the country. Mr Masauni said during the current financial year, the ministry allocated 150m/- for finalising repairs of a number of police posts as well as opening new ones. In his remarks in response to a question from Bahi MP Omar Badwel (CCM), he said his office was aware of a decade-long idle structure at Chipanga which was built by wananchi specifically for the police. The building which was dormant for 13 years, needs repairs before it is commissioned as a new police post, the deputy minister said. Eng Masauni furthermore said the government was considering to review all districts that needed additional police units. Earlier, Ms Ester Matiko (Tarime Urban, Chadema) raised concern over the eight wards being served by only one police station. This, she pointed out, made it difficult for the force to respond to security threats in faraway areas. The MP said it was also unfortunate that the area had only one police patrol vehicle. Eng Masauni conceded that the ministry faced financial difficulties, but reiterated the government’s commitment to address the problem
