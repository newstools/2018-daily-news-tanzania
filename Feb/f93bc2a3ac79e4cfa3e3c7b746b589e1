Mr Samaje faces two counts relating to provision of mining licences and areas to two companies, Tanzanite One Mining Limited and State Mining Corporation. The Acting Commissioner denied the charges before Senior Resident Magistrate Victoria Nongwa. However, the Magistrate granted him bail on conditions of securing two reliable sureties, who each signed a bond of 50m/-. The Court ordered the accused not to leave the country without obtaining the court's permission. The case was adjourned to February 28, for preliminary hearing
