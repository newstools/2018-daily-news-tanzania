The new plan was given ‘green light’ by acting OSHA Chief Executive Officer Ms Khadija Mwenda when addressing graduates at the National Occupational Safety and health course in the city this week. She said that officials from OSHA were still not recognised and respected by some employers, arguing that was holding back implementation of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, 2003. “The legislation categorically insists that employers should form safety and health committee whose members are representatives of the workers,’’ she insisted. Section 13 (1) of the same law says that an employer shall in respect of each factory or work place where two or more health and safety representatives have been designated, establish one or more committees and, at every meeting of such a committee, at every meeting of such a committee, consult with the committee for the purpose of initiating, developing, promoting, maintaining and reviewing, measures to ensure the health and safety of his employees at work. According to Ms Mwenda, if the plan is anything to go by OSHA believes that all employers will equally employ occupational and health experts whose main duty will be supervising workers. She sent a message to graduands of the course to be the best ambassadors of occupational and health matters at their work places. “We expect that you will represent us well in your different work places and implement whatever you learnt from OSHA,’’ she added.
