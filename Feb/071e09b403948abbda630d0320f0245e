Plan International Project Manager for Countering Child Marriages and FGM in Mara and Geita regions, Ms Emma Mashobe disclosed at the commemorations to mark the International Day of Zero Tolerance to FGM in Dar es Salaam, yesterday. According to Ms Mashobe, in areas such as Mara Region, it is believed that if a girl or woman is not mutilated, she is responsible for the misery of the society. “The girl or woman is held responsible in case of drought and any kind of hardships in the family… however, for a woman to be married and bring good luck, she has to be mutilated,” said Ms Mashobe. “To implement the project in 30 villages of Mara and Geita regions, we received a funding of 600,000 euro from the European Union (EU) to reduce harmful practices of child marriages and FGM,” she noted. Ms Mashobe revealed that its aim is to reach 3,700 girls and boys aged between 10-19 years and out of school girls and boys of 10-24 years. The project has engaged traditional and religious leaders, parents, teachers, police and local government leaders. Upon the projects arrival in the regions, she said the prevalence rate of FGM has gone down by two per cent from 42 per cent in 2016. Implementing partners including Plan International Tanzania, Children’s Dignity Forum (CDF),Tackle Africa, Molly’s Network and Tanzania Football Federation are working to ensure that girls and young women are empowered through awareness raising sessions. EU ambassador to Tanzania, Mr Roeland van de Beer, in his remarks said that the rate of FGM in Tanzania currently stands at 15 per cent; it is also anticipated that if the current state continues, 68 million girls will be cut between 2015 and 2030. “We are committed to fight against FGM, as in maintaining peace and enhancing respect for Human Rights violations,” observed the Ambassador. FGM Champion, Paulina Daniel (19) who is also a victim, noted that the knowledge acquired has encouraged her to help others overcome the misery
