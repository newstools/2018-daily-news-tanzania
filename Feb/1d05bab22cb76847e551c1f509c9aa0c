The Deputy Minister for Industries, Trade and Investment, Ms Stella Manyanya said at the factory in Njiro, Arusha Region that the appliances may be used by rural farmers to set up small scale industries. “With the current industrialisation trend, the government will initiate competition among technological institutions that are public-owned so as to establish those make good use of funds offered to them,” she said. Ms Manyanya pointed out that kinds of appliances are such as those making juice so that fruits that are produced in rural areas are effectively added value on. She said that it would also put an eye so as to establish those make machines but are not delivered to Tanzanians for use so that disciplinary and legal actions are taken against its executives. Speaking when touring the factory, Ms Manyanya called on TEMDO to liaise with district councils throughout the country and sign contracts to produce for them the appliances. She specified other types of machines as brick-making ones. She said it was high time that TEMDO generated income so that it becomes selfreliant instead of expecting grants from the government. She said the machines should be of high quality but simple and affordable in price. She said most farmers are engaged in production of many types of crops and TEMDO would do well to go to them and see what kind of machines they need and promptly supply them with for their economic emancipation. TEMDO Executive Director, Mr Kalutu Koshima pledged to work on the directives, starting with researches in rural areas to establish what is needed before engaging in production. He said the institution was cash-strapped especially on research front, but said they were gearing towards extending their expertise to rural areas
