According to the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) monthly economic activities for January this year, growth of credit to all major economic activities declined. During the month under review, personal loans and credit to trade activities remained dominant, accounting for 19.9 per cent and 19.5 per cent of total outstanding credit to the private sector, respectively. Domestic credit contracted by 3.5 per cent in the year ending December 2017 compared to a growth of 2.5 per cent in the year to December 2016 and with a decline of 4.0 per cent in the year to November 2017. The decline was driven by contraction in net credit to the central government from the banking system, which reflects sustained build-up of government deposits at the BoT. Specifically, net credit to the government from the banking system dropped by 23.5 per cent compared with a decline of 12.3 per cent and 25.0 per cent in the corresponding period in 2016 and November 2017, respectively. Meanwhile, the annual growth of central government borrowing from banks slowed down to 37.9 per cent in December 2017 from 40.8 per cent in November 2017 as reflected in the banksâ€™ holding of government securities. In the meantime, the annual growth of extended broad money supply was 8.0 per cent in December 2017 compared with 3.4 per cent and 9.1 per cent registered in December 2016 and November 2017, respectively. The growth of money supply was in part a reflection of sustained accommodative monetary policy stance that has been taken for almost a year to revive credit expansion. Part of this policy direction was implemented through purchase of foreign exchange from the interbank foreign exchange market, which led to the increase in net foreign assets (NFA) of the Bank of Tanzania. NFA of the banking system grew by 41.7 per cent in the year ending December 2017 compared to a contraction of 0.7 per cent in the year ending in December 2016 but was slightly lower than the growth of 45.2 per cent in the year to November 2017. Much of the increase in NFA of the banking system was reflected in foreign exchange holdings of the BoT.
