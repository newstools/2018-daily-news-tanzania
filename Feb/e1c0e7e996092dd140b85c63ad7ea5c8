The Kwimba council Chairman, Mr Peter Ngassa, said here yesterday they expect to harvest 30,000 tonnes of cotton during this harvesting season, which starts in May up from 6,500 tonnes last season. Mr Ngassa noted that the rise in cotton harvest this season has been motivated by efforts done by their District Commissioner (DC), Mr Mtemi Msafiri to organise farming courses on modern agricultural practices. The Ilula Ward Councillor, Mr Amos Kiyuga said the expected bumper harvests would be a result of efforts by their DC and the role played by Agricultural extension officers in their district. Mr Kiyuga said cotton farmers in his wards have been responding positively by using modern agricultural practices by the adequate supply of seeds UKMO8, insecticides, sprayers and fertilisers. He also warned farmers during the harvesting season they should not mix cotton and sand because thdestroys the quality of cotton outputs.
