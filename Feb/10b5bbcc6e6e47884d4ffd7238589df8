“We are now conducting research to see how we will be sending the money to the beneficiaries through the mobile system, to spare them of the inconvenience of queuing at district council offices,” the Minister in the President’s Office (Public Service and Good Governance), Mr George Mkuchika, has remarked. He was speaking in Parliament yesterday, in response to a question from Kigoma Urban MP Zitto Kabwe (ACTWazalendo). He had sought clarification on how the government would continue to give money to poor families while during preparations for the current budget, the same government vowed to drop the cash transfer system. Mr Kabwe reminded Parliament that the government had pledged that it would direct the funds for empowering the poor economically, directly to the would-be beneficiaries. In the basic question, Kaliua MP, Ms Magdalena Sakaya (CUF), wanted to know when the government would implement the Tasaf phase III in the villages of Kaliua constituency that missed the opportunity during the previous phases. The minister explained that Tasaf phase III was underway in 159 councils, including Pemba and Unguja. TASAF III has four components: The Productive Social Safety Net (PSSN), which is made up of a basic grant (unconditional cash transfer), a conditional cash transfer and a public works subcomponent; enhancement of livelihoods and increasing incomes, which involves community savings and investments and livelihood enhancing grants. It also targeted infrastructure development and capacity building which focuses on ensuring adequate programme implementation by communities, local government authorities and regional and national level players). Mr Mkuchika said the government was aware of some poor families that qualified to get the grant but were not reached, noting the government was in the initial stages of preparing the second round of Tasaf III that would cover all families.
