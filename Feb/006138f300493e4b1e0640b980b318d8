Deputy Minister Mgalu gave the directives during her visit to Nyumba ya Mungu Dam, which is situated in Mwanga District, in Kilimanjaro Region, during her official visit in the region, recently. “Preserving the environment around water sources will help us get enough water in this dam, enough to generate electricity,” she said. She added that environmental degradation around different water sources in the country has been a huge challenge, especially in areas which produce electricity. “This situation has led to the decrease of electricity output which is one of the biggest challenges as far as power production is concerned and which needs to be looked at quickly,” she said. Earlier, the Acting Manager with the Nyumba ya Mungu Dam Station, Mr Clarence Mahunda said water level in the dam had decreased following a drop in the amount of water flowing into the water source. “The situation has been caused by, among other things, human activities which are being carried in and around the dam. The station which has the capacity to produce eight megawatts of electricity in 24 hours now produces only 3.5 to four megawatts,” he said. The Manager attributed the situation to human activities such as agriculture and livestock grazing as well as fishing.
