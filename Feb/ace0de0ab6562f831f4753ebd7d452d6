The advice was given in Dar es Salaam yesterday by Chinese Minister of State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC), Mr Zhang Mao during a business luncheon prepared by Tanzania Private Sector Foundation (TPSF). “SMEs need to be supported to grow from small enterprises to medium and large businesses; in doing so training them is crucial as most of them do not have proper knowledge on how to maintain their businesses,” he noted. Mr Mao said some SMEs in China face the same challenge as they have no skills to manage business especially in financing them to flourish. He further said though China economy was growing from high speed to the high-quality economy it is still a developing country that has many people living under poverty line so it is their task to eliminate that. Expounding further he said 13 million employment opportunities are produced each year and the majority of them were from private enterprises. TPSF Chairman, Dr Reginald Mengi, said the two countries were blessed with enormous opportunities including demographic dividend, in that way market access was essential for ensuring optimisation of these opportunities. “Agricultural exports to China will be among the many ways of bridging trade balances between our two countries with an ultimate objective of raising the standard of living of our people, maintain and enhance economic stability,” he said.
