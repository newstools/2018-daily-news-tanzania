The councillors presented their plea to have the executive director removed to Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa on Thursday evening when he toured Sengerema District. The councillors wanted the PM to leave with Mr Luanda after Mr Majaliwa held a meeting with Buchosa council civil servants. The Premier encountered complaints from the councillors during his first day of the tour of Mwanza Region. Having received the request from councillors, the Prime Minister ordered Mwanza Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr John Mongella to visit the council and hold a meeting with councillors, the Executive Director and civil servants to resolve the dispute. Earlier yesterday, Prime Minister Majaliwa laid a foundation stone for the construction of Buchosa council hospital in Sengerema District which is planned to cost a whopping 10.5 billion/-. PM Majaliwa inaugurated four classrooms at Nyehunge Secondary School in Sengerema District. He called upon students to concentrate in their studies now that the government offers free basic education. He also asked teachers not to involve themselves in collecting contributions; instead, they should concentrate in teaching. “If there are any contributions from any individuals, groups or institutions the council director should receive them,” he insisted. He said it was unfair for students to be ordered to either stay or return home upon failure by their parents to pay contributions to schools.
