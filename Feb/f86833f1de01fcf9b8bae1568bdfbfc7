Reading culture brings about mental stimulation, stress reduction, knowledge and vocabulary expansion and memory improvement. It also helps to strengthen analytical thinking skills and improve focus and concentration. Kagera Regional Education Development Officer, Mr Aloys Kamamba made the call on Monday while launching “KIO KIT” which is linked with Information Communication Technology (ICT) system. “People should not hesitate to utilise library services to get more knowledge. Education has no end….the more you read the more you expand your knowledge and get exposure,” he said before thanking the UK- based Book Aid International for the timely assistance. Kagera Regional Librarian, Faustin Kato appealed for government intervention and donors to get sufficient funds for rehabilitation and expansion of the outdated library building. He noted that the library building was launched in 1968, and by that time Bukoba Municipality’s population was about 2,335 while the number increased to 128,796 in 2013. “The building is outdated and there is urgent need to rehabilitate and expand it to enable more people to effectively utilize the services,” he said. “KIO KIT” technology is equipped with 40 tablets containing various topics suitable for pupils and students in primary, secondary, colleges and adults.
