The Central Zone WV Manager, Mr Faraja Kalunga, said here over the weekend that Chemba had became the seventh district to carry out the campaign, citing the others as Bahi, Kongwa, Kilosa, Manyoni, Iramba and Singida Rural. “We came up with the idea to conduct the campaign after conducting a survey to establish the scale of the problem in the areas,” said the Central Zone WV Manager during an event to launch the campaign in Chemba. Mr Kalunga said the five-year campaign was also aimed at encouraging parents and guardians to join hands with the government and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) in initiatives to curb child marriages, to enable girls complete all levels of education, as a curtain raiser for a bright future. “The campaign has registered considerable achievements in districts which started to carry out the initiatives,” he said. Mr Kalunga said the main goal of the campaign was to complement the government’s effort to prevent adolescent pregnancy, saying pregnancies among girls aged below 18 had irreparable consequences.
