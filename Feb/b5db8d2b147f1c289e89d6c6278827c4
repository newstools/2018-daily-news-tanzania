Ambassador Sijaona said she was thrilled to learn that a group for youth had already raised over 10m/- in obligatory contributions and its income was steadily rising. The group has finalised plans to use part of the money to engage in economic projects, starting with poultry and animal rearing, to create jobs for house wives and young people. She described the group’s plans as great ideas with lasting impact on the society and asked other social groups to emulate Uwaruto’s example by creating jobs for Tanzanians, especially women and youth. “Unemployment is a global problem. In Tanzania, unemployment is huge national challenge,” she said. According to a paper by Professors Alfred Agwanda and Haidari Amani, (released 2012) figures of the National Bureau of Statistics show that the youth (aged 15-24) constitute 19 per cent of Tanzania’s population. Ambassador Sijaona said well-managed business projects will create jobs at grassroots level, adding that if Uwaruto will give gainful employment to a number of people in Temeke District that will be an important contribution to the nation. She said successful business projects are offering needed services and producing locally produced merchandise for Tanzanians. “If the products and services are good and competitive, that is a big contribution to our society and to improving national income.” Ambassador Sijaona said, adding that well-managed projects could offer employment to members who can no longer be employed anywhere else because of unexpected disabilities
