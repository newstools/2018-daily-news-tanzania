The mining company said in a statement last week that it has received confirmation from TANESCO that a work session for the full PPA task team has been scheduled for Tuesday this week to finalise work on key deliverables stipulated under the MoU. Representatives from Kibo and Tanesco will attend the session, which is aimed at finalising work on the various key deliverables stipulated under the MCPP memorandum of understanding (MoU). The meeting will also be used to review the overall progress and remaining deliverables and milestones stipulated in the MCPP MoU and discuss and agree steps and measures, where necessary, to ensure that the MoU timeline and action plan are executed in accordance with what has been agreed. “We are very pleased with the cooperation and commitment from Tanesco in advancing the PPA process since signing the MoU, despite extraordinary challenges experienced by Tanesco over the past three months, in particular,” Kibo CEO Louis Coetzee is quoted as saying in a statement. Kibo Mining PLC signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Tanzania Electric Supply Company, TANESCO, in February this year with regards to a Power Purchase Agreement for power that will be produced from Kibo’s 300MW Mbeya coalto- power project. Kibo said the meeting will also review the overall progress and remaining deliverables under the MoU and discuss measures to ensure that the timeline and action plan is executed in line with what has been agreed. “This work session of the full PPA task team follows a period of work by the task team that commenced immediately after signing of the MoU and during which we expect to bring their efforts together in positive and productive results in respect of the agreed deliverables stated in the PPA MoU.”
