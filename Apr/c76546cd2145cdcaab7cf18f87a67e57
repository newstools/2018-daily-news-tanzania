Construction of the multi-purpose dam has remained stalled for some time now due to lack of a passable road to transport machinery for the project. But speaking in the National Assembly here yesterday, the Minister in charge of Water and Irrigation, Eng Isack Kamwelwe, said his office has allocated money in the next financial year to finance construction of the road. “We have allocated funds to the project and we will ask Members of Parliament to approve it when it is tabled so we can start the construction work,” he said. The Minister was reacting to a supplementary question posed by Uzini legislator Salum Rehani (CCM). The lawmaker had asked whether the government was committed to constructing the road required to support the work at the multi-billion shilling project which is also expected to generate electricity and help smallholder farmers. “Equally, I wish to know whether the government undertook sufficient environmental impact assessment regarding erosion and chemicals that will come with the project,” he said. The Minister said the impact assessment report was conducted and the findings shows there will be no effects. He said the reports also provide for options in the case there are any effects resulting from the construction work. Deputy Minister for Water and Irrigation Mr Jumaa Aweso said the assessment shows that there will be chemicals which will be applied to control water hyacinth on the downstream where farming activities take place. Upon construction the dam is scheduled to use 432 million cubic litres daily for irrigation.
