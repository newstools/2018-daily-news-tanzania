Ms Itemba said that the 100th house was built in favour of a young girl student Evamary John Mushi (10) who is currently raised by her paternal grandmother. "Our research concerning this project made us meet Evamary, a standard four pupil; she lost her mother while she was two years of age, her father is very ill that he now can’t afford to serve her well including her education,” she said. The study further found out that following the situation at home Evamary was now being raised by her paternal grandmother who in recent years now also couldn’t serve her well due to old age.
