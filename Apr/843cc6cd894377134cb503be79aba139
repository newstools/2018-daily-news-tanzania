Chemba Municipal Attorney, Mr Geoffrey Pima, noted here yesterday that authorities from both districts would convene a joint meeting soon to wrap up the issue. "Authorities in Chemba and Chamwino had dispatched a team of land officers from both districts to resolve the disputes after villagers of Kidoka and Muungano complained over encroachment by residents from Chamwino," said the Chemba Municipal Attorney. Mr Pima said Chemba District had also resolved the border dispute between Handa villagers and communities living near Migori Forest Reserve in Chemba. He explained that the communities near the forest were claiming that Handa villagers had encroached the Migori Forest Reserve. "The security and defence committees from the two districts of Chemba and Singida met and resolved the issue. Mr Pima pointed out that one of the reasons behind the dispute was the move by some villagers to remove beacons. The Chemba District Executive Director, Dr Semistatus Mashimba, explained that land and border disputes had been resolved by land officers from municipal councils. He elaborated further that disputes over land ownership had been resolved by legal organs as land tribunals in ward and district. "Land disputes referred to my office or district commissioner have been resolved by involving municipal attorney and land officers," he said. Dr Mashimba said the municipal council directs people involved in land disputes to open cases in court due to their complex nature, pointing out that the municipal council resolved cases in various sectors ,including agriculture and livestock.
