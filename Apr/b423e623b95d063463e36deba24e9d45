At the event, exemplary women in the country were saluted. According to the VP, the government was doing all it took to ensure that women’s role in critical areas like politics, leadership, public service, business, economy, education and health was manifested and acknowledged. She remarked further: “We will continue doing this with no hesitation as it is stipulated in the CCM Manisfesto and it is the will of President John Magufuli.” She recalled sentiments by the Father of the Nation, Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, that, if women were not entrusted with leadership positions, the nation would be half independent and half slaves, and would never record appreciable development. The VP commended UWT, the women’s wing of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi, for introducing the awards, focused on acknowledging the various exemplary roles of women in various sectors, for the nation’s development. She pointed out that the awards were a powerful reminder of the women’s sterling roles in the liberation and national building missions. “It is heartening to note that the acknowledgement of these women’s roles will be a consistent exercise; I am requesting to UWT, as organisers, to ensure that the process is run openly by adhering to all the criteria that have been agreed on, so that the awards match the inputs,” she remarked.
