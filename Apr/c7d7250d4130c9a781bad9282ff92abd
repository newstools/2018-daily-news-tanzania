We want to meet our customers at their point of convenience. NIC LIPA achieves precisely this as it allows our customers to conduct all basic bank transactions via their mobile phones,” said Mick Karima, the Acting Managing Director of NIC Bank Tanzania. This solution offers customers a broad range of services in the comfort of their mobile phones, including bank to M-Pesa Funds Transfers, M-Pesa to Bank Funds Transfers, LipaKwa M-Pesa till payments and bulk payments. The launch of NIC Lipa is part of the bank’s broader strategy to enhance convenience for customers through technology and innovation. Mr Karima added that Corporate and SME customers who adopt NIC LIPA to make payments will greatly benefit as the service provides access to payment settlements through their accounts at NIC Bank. The same clients will also be able to receive M-PESA payments from their clients in their accounts with NIC Bank. This will enable valued customers to eliminate cash from their premises which is a big risk that all businesses face today. “ This partnership is of great value to our customers because it broadens the range of digital financial services that they will benefit through our M-Pesa platform,” said Ashutosh Tiwary, M-Commerce Director. He also added that this new partnership cements Vodacom’s objective to digitise Tanzania through its various innovative services that make life better for every Tanzanian. “Our mobile money platform continues to simplify the day-today operations of our customers by making services like banking and payments easily accessible” he added. The launch of NIC LIPA in NIC Bank Tanzania builds on the Group’s success in Kenya, where it is a major player in digital solutions
