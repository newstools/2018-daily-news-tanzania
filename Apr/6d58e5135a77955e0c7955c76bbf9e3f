The minister made the call in Tanga city on Saturday where she launched a national cervical cancer vaccine campaign and cervical cancer diagnosis on women at the Ngamiani health centre. “I want to assure Tanzanians that cervical cancer is preventable … if the signs are detected at an early stage … both men and women should attend at selected health centres and hospitals for diagnosis … men (in particular) don’t be bothered with rumours “ she insisted. She elaborated that statistics from the Cancer Institute at the premiere Ocean Road Hospital indicate that non-communicable diseases were affecting at least 50,000 patients each year – out of whom 33 per cent were diagnosed with cervical cancer signs and 12 per cent with signs of breast cancer.
