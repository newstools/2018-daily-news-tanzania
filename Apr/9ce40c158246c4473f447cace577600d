Senior State Attorney Jacqueline Nyantori gave the order at the Kisutu Resident Magistrate’s Court in Dar es Salaam last Friday when the case came for mention. She informed Principal Resident Magistrate Thomas Simba that investigations into the matter are at advanced stages. “There are only two issues that have remained in order to complete the investigations. The DPP has given the DCI two weeks to work on those issues. Under such circumstances, your honour, we pray for another mention date,” she asked without going much in detail to disclose on the said two issues. The magistrate appeared to have been satisfied with the prosecution’s positive progress in conducting the investigations and adjourned the trial for another mention on May 4, hoping that in the next court session more encouraging report would be given. Other prominent figures facing the criminal charges in the trial are former Managing Director with Tanzania Investment Bank (TIB), Peter Noni, Managing Director of Six Telecoms Company Limited, Hafidh Shamte, alias Rashid Shamte and Noel Chacha, the Company’s Chief Finance Officer. They have been charged in the case jointly with Six Telecoms Company Limited on account of their positions in the company. Apart from Shamte and Chacha, the charge sheet indicates that Dr Tenga and Dr Noni are also directors of the tier one provider of integrated telecommunications Services Company. The prosecution alleges that the accused persons committed the offences on different dates between January 2014 and January 2016, within the city and region of Dar es Salaam.
