Rukwa Regional Police Commander (RPC) Mr George Kyando told the “Daily News” over the phone that no arrest has been made. Mr Mugo and his wife are still on the run despite a two-week manhunt for them. He said that it is most likely that they are in hiding in a neighboring region. The RPC vowed that no stone will remain untouched until the fugitives are arrested and prosecuted. Some reports have it that Mugo and his wife had on different occasions forcibly married off their daughters but the evil leaked after their 14-year-old daughter escaped from the ‘husband’ and surrendered herself to Nkasi District Police Station in Namanyere Town, objecting to the forceful marriage to the 75-year husband. Reports from Swaila Village have it that the Mugos had towards the end of last year forcibly married off their 16-year-old daughter to the old man who paid a dowry of 50 head of cattle . The newly married girl allegedly ran away from her husband because of his advanced age and the fact that the old man already had four wives, 50 children and an unknown numbers of grand children and grand grand children. Mugo’s neighbours, who preferred anonymity, told this paper at different interviews that his first wife has 14 children, the second has 13 while the third and fourth wives have 12 and 11 children, respectively. According to the RPC after the ‘husband’ discovered that his youngest ‘wife’ had escaped from her matrimonial house at Swaila Village, he rushed to his father-in-law, demanding the refund of all his dowry, because the wife had ran away from him. “However, the Mugos consoled their in-law with another ‘wife’ aged 14 years old to fill the gap left by her fugitive sister…. because he was not ready at all to refund the dowry,” said the
