The Standard Bank’s Chief Executive Officer in Tanzania, Sanjay Rughani said in Dar es Salaam over the weekend that the bank had closed more than 40 deals related to Belt and Road initiative last year. “Standard Chartered has footprints in 45 of the Belt and Road countries particularly in the regions with the most dynamic activities including South East Asia, South Asia and Africa,” he said at an event hosted by the bank for Chinese clients. “Our commitment to facilitate Belt and Road financing is largely as an intermediary and service provider across a full range of lending, financial markets, transaction banking, capital markets and project finance activities,” He said 50 per cent of the deals closed in 2017 are made in Africa, 25 per cent in South Asia and the rest are across the Belt and Road footprint. The Belt and Road Initiative is a significant development strategy launched by the Chinese government with the intention of promoting economic co-operation among countries along the proposed Belt and Road routes. The Initiative has been designed to enhance the orderly free-flow of economic factors and the efficient allocation of resources. It is also intended to further market integration and create a regional economic co-operation framework of benefit to all. It was cited as a priority for the further opening of China’s economy at the recent 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
