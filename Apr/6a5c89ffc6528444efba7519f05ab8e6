The Minister explained this before Members of Parliament after an opposition legislator queried whether the State’s push for an industrialised economy was “realistic.” Momba MP David Silinde (Chadema) wondered as to when the government will build an industry in his area. He argued that there has not been a positive tie between the private sector and government yet infrastructures including roads and electricity were not ready to accommodate industrialisation. “If I may say the private sector has no capital to invest in these industries,” he claimed. But responding to the query, Mr Mwijage said there was no private sector without the government and vice versa. “We’re all linked. The government does not build industries but private sector does. Our job is to create the needed environment for the private sector to work,” he said. According to the Minister, the government’s envisioned industrial sector growth is centred on the need to transform the country’s economy to a middle income country by 2025. “This is our guidance. We’re also guided by the second five-year development plan and we also follow advice from President John Magufuli,” he said. The 2016/17 to 2020/21 plan was adopted to ensure Tanzania graduate into a middle income country. The government is committed to enact and develop a conducive policy and legal frameworks, infrastructures and strategies to support trade and industry which is the arm or the private sector
