The parliamentary committee issued the call to executives and chairpersons of the public companies and corporations here yesterday, saying it will hardly tolerate public and corporations which seek subsidies from the state day in day out. “Executives who are lacking capacity to supervise the public companies and corporations can step down to give room for others with capacity,” said the Committee Chairman, Dr Raphael Chegeni. Mr Chegeni was briefing reporters on his committee’s activities for the past three weeks here, saying the main goal of his committee was to advise on improved efficiency of public companies and corporations in investment. He said the government had invested about 48.5trillion/- in public companies and corporations to generate profits and improve services to the public, saying the government should see the outcome of its huge investment in the public companies and corporations. “Every executive should carry out duties to improve operations of their respective public companies and corporations to serve the people better,” he observed. Dr Chegeni further noted that public companies and corporations should be run efficiently so that the companies or corporations can give dividend to the government to relieve the government with burden of budget. “We want to see all public companies and corporations contributing at least the total of 1tri/- to the state coffers in the upcoming fiscal year,” he said. As for public institutions which do not pay dividend to the government, Dr Chegeni said the parliamentary committee expected them to improve provision of public services, stressing that they should come up with strategies to generate profits to stop depending on subsidies. He urged the people to support the government by paying taxes to contribute to the national development
