The NMB Dar es Salaam Zonal Manager Mr Badru Iddi said in city yesterday after launching digital library at Kisutu Girls Secondary School that the computers will enable building e-library for accessing latest reference materials. “We continue to support the government endeavours in enhancing use of ICT in providing modern educations in order to produce expertise in various fields necessary for building strong economy,” he said after handing over 10 computers to Kisutu Girls Secondary School. He added that the initiative of enhancing ICT use in primary and secondary schools through computers will equip students particularly in science subjects that are catalysts in innovations. “To ensure connectivity and smooth use of computers donated, we use our staff to support schools with connectivity and the first experience using computers in the schools,” he said. Mr Iddi said last year the bank set aside 1.5bn/- in its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to support education, where 900m/- have already been spent in desks. “Education is one of the key sectors that NMB supports in its CSR package annually,” he said, mentioning other sectors like health, creating awareness on financial capability and recovery support. Also he said the bank works closely with the government through Wajibu Propositions to impart financial knowledge to students as well as opening bank account and maintaining it. On her part, the Wilson Global Initiative (WGI) representative Ms Brenda Mutembei said the software installed on the computers donated by NMB will help students access latest reference materials. “Digital library software will ease students to access up-todate reference materials in science subjects and other areas of learning,” she said.
