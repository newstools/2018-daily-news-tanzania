The new development comes following recent announcement by the Minister for Agriculture, Dr Charles Tizeba who said this year’s Nane Nane exhibitions will take place in Simiyu Region for the first time in history. “We are ready for the grand event and we are planning to engage every willing partner so that they can take part and use this year’s Nane Nane gala to showcase and promote their technologies in agriculture, fishing and livestock undertakings,” said Mr Anthony Mtaka, Simiyu Regional Commissioner. He said the private sector is also encouraged to set structures and pavilions that will suit the needs of the international requirement and status with his office providing guidance on the whole arrangement. He said his office and the Tanzania Trade Development Authority (TANTRADE) have launched strategic agenda that will facilitate to a joint collaboration in realising the exhibitions. Other partners who will be approached to participate include the diplomatic missions both in the country and the Diaspora to invite their companies and the business community to take part and introduce their products and technologies as well. As part of the preparations, Mr Mtaka said different forums will be held and that among other participants, the Tanzania Standard Newspapers Ltd (TSN) will be invited as one of the key stakeholders with remarkable records and contributions in the development of Simiyu region in the past. On his side, the TANTRADE boss, Mr Rutageruka said his Authority will make sure this year’s Nane Nane in Simiyu Region records desirable achievements by connecting it to various local and international business partners. He said his office is determined to see upcountry regionsare also capable of organising international trade expos like it was the case with the Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair (DITF), adding this year’s Agribusiness show in Simiyu region will slowly but surely start following the DITF footsteps. The new structures and pavilions will be built at Nyakibindi grounds about 15 km from the Bariadi Township which has been earmarked to host the event to be organised under the new arrangement where Simiyu, Mara and Shinyanga regions will now form their own Nane Nane zone.
