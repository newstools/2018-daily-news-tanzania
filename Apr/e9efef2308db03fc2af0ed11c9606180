The remark was made here by the Northern Zone’s Deputy Land Commissioner, Leo Komba, while briefing the press on new strategies and related processes in settling payments for land levies, as well as addressing land related problems in Arusha, Manyara and Kilimanjaro regions. “We intend to collect the fore-said amount before the end of this fiscal year, which should be in mid-June,” further said Mr Komba. Apparently during the previous fiscal year, the Ministry collected the same amount of 13 billion/-. “Settling of land levies among tenants this year has been lagging behind, so far it is only 40 per cent (which is around 5.2 billion/-) that has been collected, and there are only two months left before the end of the 2017-2018 financial year. “We only collect levies from surveyed plots and land; it is important for people to differentiate between land levies and property taxes as many tend to mix the two during payments or when contacted to settle their dues,” clarified Mr Komba.
