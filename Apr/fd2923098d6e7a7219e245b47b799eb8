The DC made the appeal here yesterday at a meeting organised by Mission Aviation Fellowship (MAF) members of staff in Chidudu Village in the District. He said the residents should cooperate with the development partners in a bid to improve social services. He was speaking at a meeting jointly organised by Dodoma-based Youth and Children Support Foundation and MAF, an international Christian organisation, whose mission is to fly light aircraft and use other technology to bring help and hope to people in rural areas. “Members of the public can play a significant role in the development projects by maintaining the projects,” he said. Youths and Children Support Foundation Coordinator, Ms Ruth Kambenga, said the two non-governmental organisations have built dispensaries in different areas in order to bring health services closer to the people. She said while her foundation constructeddispensaries, MAF has been putting up airstrips to facilitate provision of health services to remote areas. MAF has been transporting patients to the health facilities and offering spiritual education to rural dwellers, he said. However, Ms Kambenga, said some villagers have a tendency of destroying infrastructure of the airstrips hence hindering the provision of health services. She pointed out that the airstrips whose construction was supported by MAF are Matongo in Bariadi, Simiyu District and Hydon, Malambo in Manyara and one in Arusha Region. “Our foundation in partnership with MAF has been providing villagers with medical support to remote areas,” she observed.
