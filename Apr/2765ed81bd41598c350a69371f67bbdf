The Deputy Minister was forced to explain the matter to lawmakers, Friday morning when he was responding to Mlalo MP Rashid Shangazi, who sought to know government stance over some higher learning institutions which do not adhere to standards as result of dropping of quality of education. "Government cannot dictate how varsities should be govern them", Mr Ole Nasha said adding that TCU took some measures against 19 varsities, banning 75 courses on the grounds he has mentioned. Asking a basic question on behalf of Special Seat MP Ester Mmasi, Mr Shangazi wanted to know measures against varsities that infringe staffs rights. Mr Ole Nasha said the varsities staff rights are protected by Labour laws hence if there are such claims should be forwarded to the government.
