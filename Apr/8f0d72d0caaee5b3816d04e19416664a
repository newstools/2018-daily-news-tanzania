The Public Service Social Security Act, proposes the establishment of the fund, the Public Service Social Security Scheme, serving all employees in the public service sector, including all employees in other pension funds.

The Bill further directs the transfer of workers in the private sector as well as voluntary contributors to the National Social Security Fund (NSSF).
