Speaking at the handing over ceremony in Dar es Salaam, TPA acting Director General Nuru Mhando pointed out that the support is part of the authority’s 13th anniversary commemorations which will climax this Sunday. Ms Mhando said the equipment will ease treatment of children attending the unit for various treatments. “TPA recognises and values the government initiatives to improve medical services... as a government agency, it’s our responsibility to support delivery of basic community services,” said Ms Mhando. She noted that TPA is duty bound to allocate part of its earnings for social responsibility particularly to improve social services like education, health, development and during natural disasters. “It is our hopes that the support we have provided will help serve many children who visit the hospital and easy the shortage of equipment at the unit...children are the future of tomorrow, it’s important that we value their good health,” she noted. Ms Mhando further observed that TPA values health of the community where it operates and that of its employees, the reason they have staged a health screening and blood donation exercise to cater for the needy. “Good health is an asset... knowing the importance of having good health, we will examine our health and donate blood to save many lives in need of the life giving liquid,” observed Ms Mhando.
