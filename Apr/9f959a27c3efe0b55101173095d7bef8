The call was made mid this week in Dar es Salaam by Dr Ave Maria Semakafu, the Deputy Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Education, Science, Technology and Vocational Training in her remarks to mark the International Girls in ICT day organized by the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA). According to Dr Semakafu, some Tanzanians think girls cannot perform certain activities, including pursuing certain academic fields, such as engineering or Information Communication Technology (ICT), a notion that was completely irrelevant. Dr Semakafu challenged the community to ensure girls are empowered especially in this era of technology advancement as they have proved that they are capable of being the best and dependable experts in the country. “ We had a special programme that aimed at facilitating girls empowerment in science subject and engineering at the University of Dar es Salaam, which has proved to be a success, showing that women and girls can do their best and solve their challenges if they are empowered,” she disclosed. She urged the community and other responsible entities to empower girls and women through ICT which has proved to be a better way of empowering women in this era of great technology advancement. She also challenged girls and women to utilize positively technology which is a big challenge in the community currently by ensuring they use it for development as well as resolving their challenges. As for this year’s anniversary slogan ‘Empowering girls to consider ICT as key enabler towards Industrial economy’ and ‘Girls with ICT towards Industrial Economy’ , Dr Semakafu made a call to participants to ask themselves what they contribute in building their country’s industrial economy
