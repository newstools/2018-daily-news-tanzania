Mr Biswalo explained that there was no proof because the bullets did not remain in the body of Akwilina Akwilline who died last February. “I have gone through the file; I did not see any evidence that could lead to prosecution of the police officers because there must be proof to accuse a particular policeman,” he said on the sidelines of the swearing in event of the new judges at the State House in Dar es Salaam. Following the death of the student, six oofficers were held for questioning after Akwilina’s death. The police came under fire for her death. Witnesses explained that she was sitting in a public bus that was passing by during a confrontation between police and protesters. President John Magufuli commented on the incident in a tweet issued in Kiswahili. He said a probe had been ordered into the incident and that the perpetrators would face justice.
