Speaking in the National Assembly here yesterday, the Ministry’s Deputy Minister, Abdallah Hamisi Ulega, told the Parliamentarians that his ministry has already submitted the recommendation to the Ministry of Finance and Planning for further actions. “We are aiming at reducing these taxes and where possible abolish them all. Our expectation is to see a boom in the production of meat and other animal products to meet the local demands. We equally want the Finance and Planning Ministry to impose additional taxes on imported animal products especially second hand products,” he pointed out. He said the country is the second in Africa with a large population of cattle after Ethiopia; however, it imports only 2,000 tonnes of meat annually. That was in response to a question from Special Seats MP (CCM), Ms Zainab Katimba, who had earlier said that although the government encourages development of industries in the country, it was also posing a big challenge in the market by imposing huge taxes on local produced products and allowing importation of similar goods.
