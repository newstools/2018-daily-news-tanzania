Dodoma Regional Police Commissioner, Mr Gilles Muroto told reporters here yesterday that of the immigrants, five are of Somali origin and the rest are from Kenya. The RPC said initial investigations have it that the immigrants enter the country through Namanga border to Arusha but the rubber stamps differed from one passport to another. He named the suspected illegal immigrants as Mussa Isaka (37), Aden Abdi (34), Abraham Ismail (22) Joseph Kibuko (33), Mohamed Kosar of Somali origin and John Mbogo (28), a Kenyan national. “The police force is commending the informers for tipping us and we call upon the bus owners to be keen as once found guilty of transporting illegal immigrants, the penalty is confiscation of the vehicle” said the RPC. He warned the ticket agents to be keen as others are being engaged in deals of transporting the illegal immigrants. Ngesere Bus Driver, Mr William Chitemo said the illegal immigrants boarded the bus from Nane Nane main stand but he was worried when he realised that the passengers were speaking by signsThe actions, he said, made him decide to ride to the Central Police station to report the matter and it was realised that they were illegal immigrants.
