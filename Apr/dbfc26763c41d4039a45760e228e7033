Water Mission International Tanzania country Director, Mr Benjamin Filskov said in Dar es Salaam yesterday that, “We assist communities to access water thus giving them opportunity to participate in other economic activities.” He added, “If you are constant sick because of using unsafe water you cannot develop because it becomes impossible to concentrate in any economic activity.” He said the access to clean and safe water was still a serious problem in many parts particularly in the rural areas . “Since we opened our offices in Tanzania, we have worked with a number of needy communities to implement water projects that have improved their lives. However, the demand is quite big with limited resources,” he said. He mentioned areas that have benefited from Water mission support as Kilimanjaro, Dodoma, Kigoma, Dar es Salaam, Tanga, Mbeya, Babati, Geita, Arusha and Kagera. He said, Water Mission works with needy local communities which approach them for support by developing projects and implementing them jointly. “Before implementing any project we spend some time to train locals on how they can manage their projects so that they can sustain it once we step out. Through this approach, our projects have become successful,” he said. He added, one unique point about Water Mission it offers water that meet World Health Organisation (WHO) standard for drinking water in all its projects.
