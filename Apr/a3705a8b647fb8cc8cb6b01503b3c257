Policy Research for Development (REPOA) Executive Director, Dr Donald Mmari made the remarks in Dar es Salaam yesterday during the institute’s 23rd Annual Research Workshop. Dr Mmari said the ongoing economic reforms aimed at attaining semi-industrial status by 2025 should consider boosting productivity and competitiveness. “According to researchers, the country’s growth has remained high above six per cent in the past 15 years. However, productivity and competitiveness have remained low in the country, this is not healthy for development,” he said. He stressed, Tanzania as part of the global economy, is duty bound to increase productivity. The two-day workshop, themed ‘towards an industrialized society by 2025: Why National Competitiveness Matters,’ has brought together researchers, policy makers, business community representatives and development partners. Dr Mmari said, Tanzania has the potential of being highly competitive due to its geographical positioning, abundant natural resources and political stability. Opening the workshop on behalf of the Vice President, Minister for Constitutional and Legal Affairs, Prof Palamagamba Kabudi said the government focuses on industrial transformation. Prof Kabudi said the government has already taken several measures including the adoption of free education policy, increased access to electricity, construction of infrastructure, improvements of port, reduction of interest from the banks as well as increasing the health budget. Executive Secretary for Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU) Paulina Elago said innovation was the most complex part of competitiveness. “Tanzania can improve its competitiveness by strengthening its capacity and capability in innovation beyond Information and Communication Technology (ICT),” she said.
