This was revealed here yesterday by Dodoma Municipal Primary Education Officer, Mr Mwisungu Kigosi, saying that the programme has so far midwifed new infrastructure in six public primary schools in Dodoma municipality. “The programme also helps to fund construction of new schools’ infrastructure including classrooms and toilets and renovation of the old classrooms,” he further said. However, Mr Kigosi commended the government for coming up with the programme, adding that it was addressing challenges facing the public institutions in the region. He said the approach has helped to increase the number of classrooms in various schools in Dodoma municipality and enable the institutions to cope with big numbers of pupils increasing in them after the free education policy call. The Officer cited Nkuhungu Primary School in Dodoma municipality as a case study, where over 600 pupils have been enrolled in Standard One this year, further including Mahomanyika, Mwenge, Ihumwa and Nzasa schools in the list. He further said the municipality’s goal was to finance the programme with collections accrued internally and fill the gap of relocated teachers in various public institutions, which have been facing acute shortage of staff. On her side, Nkuhungu Primary School Head Girl, Zena Yusufu, expressed her gratitude to the programme, saying it was helping them to address some of the challenges facing them like construction of latrines at their institution.
