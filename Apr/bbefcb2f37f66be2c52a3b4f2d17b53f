Speaking shortly at the Kisutu Resident Magistrate’s Court after Senior Resident Magistrate Wilbald Mashauri ruled in their favour, GCLA Legal Officers, said the ruling is an indication of how they are dealing with chemical management against unlicenced importation, distribution and sale of chemicals in the country. “This is a clear indication that we are determined to handle the chemical management in the country, Chief Government Chemist is the sole registrar of all those involved in the business, thus they have to abide by the laid down rules and regulations. According to the judgment, the Oakwood Holdings Ltd has been ordered to pay fine as well as confiscation of 40,000 litres of the chemicals which will be handed over to the GCLA. On his part, Director of Oakwood Holdings Ltd, Mr Simon Kariuki, agreed with the judgement saying they were not aware of the need to register before importation of such chemicals.
