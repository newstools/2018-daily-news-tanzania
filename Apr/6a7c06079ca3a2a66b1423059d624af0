Since last year, Mr Ndugai was outside parliament and had not presided over parliamentary sessions. Yesterday, the Speaker was delightfully welcomed by lawmakers who had missed his company. Virtually, every MP who stood up in the debating chamber to make contributions started by welcoming the Speaker back to the parliament, wishing him well in the course of discharging his duties in the august House. Immediately after the Question and Answer session, Mr Ndugai thanked all Tanzanians who had prayed him when he was undergoing treatment in India. “I wish to thank all MPs, my electorate in Kongwa constituency, and all Tanzanians who remembered me through their prayers, and I can now tell you all that I have recovered,’’ he said. He further thanked Deputy Speaker, Dr Tulia Ackson and all chairpersons of the House. The Speaker paid special tribute to Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa who he said had regularly phoned him, to enquire about his health status. “Sometimes when you are seriously sick and you don’t have people closer to you, you feel like you will die tomorrow, but I thank the Prime Minister who called me on several occasions,’’ he said, amid cheers from other MPs.
