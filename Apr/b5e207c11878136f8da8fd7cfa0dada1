Next thing I saw were angry exchanges on the floor of the House of Commons on the Windrush generation, I knew there was fire beneath the smoke. But Britain is such a good example of how we can mix races and colours, most of whom hail from its former colonies. How did a child whose parents may have been granted citizenship decades ago turn into an illegal alien, to be treated as a criminal? My answer was an uncomfortable one. He is black, possibly like a black kettle, the black sheep in a family, a black book in a school principal’s hand, or the blacklist in a social or economic group. Black is bad and white is good. I wonder why they do not make white tyres for vehicles. Perhaps it is why we have so many road accidents and especially at night. Anyway, the ship named Windrush that brought about 500 Jamaicans to the UK in 1948 must have been painted black. It was a time when labour was in short supply after the 2nd world war. In 1971 Britain enacted a law that gave commonwealth citizens already living in the UK indefinite stay. Many of them assumed they were as British as cricket and polo, worked diligently, paid taxes, obeyed the laws of the land and behaved as good citizens. Until 2012 when someone introduced stricter rules on immigration and then witch hunters went to work. Some Windrush folks been detained, others denied social services like health that are free for citizens, and attempts to deport some may have been prevented the diligent work of costly lawyers. But has this kind of treatment been applied to white immigrants from say Italy, the Balkans or Nordic countries? Will we ever find out? According to the Guardian, members of the Windrush generation describe how on leaving the UK, they were deported upon return and could not join families. Whatever evidence of their arrival, stay, work or tax receipts that they presented to embassies and immigration staff was deemed not good enough. For many, a nightmare situation they never expected to experience. How the British official system has been treating black people of Caribbean descent may have become a topic on the sidelines of the recent commonwealth heads of government meeting. However, it is a symptom of rising intolerance and animosity towards immigrants in Europe and USA particularly black residents. We can add Asians and Latinos in the mix. Am not a racist, nor do I intend to be. After all I come from Mwalimu Nyerere’s time. He taught us that all humans are our brethren and we are all equals. A mzungu, the term in Kiswahili for a white person, is just another human, nothing special. I have had my share of ‘special treatment’ at points of entry of several countries. In Cairns and Perth in Australia, I was thoroughly interrogated and searched and luggage taken out piece after piece, while being asked to describe where I got/bought each item. After that I stopped going through Australia. I was working in Papua New Guinea by then. In USA a dozen or so years before The Donald became the most powerful president on mother Earth, I was always the only black person in a jumbo jet who was taken aside and body searched and interrogated in an office. It happened in San Fransisco, Boston and New York. After 9/11 my passport would have an S sticker, probably meaning search, suspicious or security risk. I would always be pulled out to join a special line. I know the USA has had issues with dark skinned people since the time of slavery and beyond when racial segregation was legal. In Holland at Amsterdam Schiphol airport. Not the UK though. I been twice to London for brief stay several years ago and was treated with courtesy and dignity. In South Africa in church during Sunday mass, I happened to be the only black in the congregation of white worshippers (did I go to the wrong church, or perhaps wrong neighbourhood?). During the offering, the person will the collection plate jumped me as if I did not have any money for my offering or perhaps they could not take my dirty money. It was definitely a racist act in the house of worship. This was in 1994 just after Mandela became president. And in Singapore the same thing happened in a church full of Chinese. Premier Lee Kuan Yew was in power then. For me it has always been all in a day’s work. Being black is only easy once am back home in Tanzania. Recently I met a mzungu couple at a friend’s birthday bash who confessed to love Tanzania enough to want to stay indefinitely. I don’t know how Italy really treats visitors of other races but he is welcome to stay in our beloved Bongoland. Americans have the Black lives matter movement. I think this is more than black lives, it is about human rights. The right of black people to receive quality basic services such as health and housing, the right to a name and nationality, and the right to be protected from discrimination and harassment. It is about black people and those of other colours being treated fairly with dignity and respect. As senior soul brother the late James Brown sang in the glorious 1970s, say it loud, am black and proud. Colour is only skin deep. Inside we have the same blood, we feel pain and love and hurt the same, whether white, black or yellow. tnaleo@hotmail.com
