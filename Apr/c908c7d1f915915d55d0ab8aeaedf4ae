Dr Mahenge issued the directive here during a recent regional consultative council (RCC) meeting, pointing out that the government’s decision to shift to the central zone region had since created a number of investment opportunities. “… we should now mobilise people into (economic) groups … particularly women and the youth … all of whom need to grab these business opportunities,” the RC said, addressing the RCC opening session. The RCC meeting brings together executives and Members of Parliament in the region to deliberate on issues pertaining to development in the region particularly development projects and regional budget. Dr Mahenge further ordered regional executives to identify likely business opportunities in the construction of Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) and Hoima-Tanga Oil Pipeline in order to prepare youth and women to grab them. “While youth will provide the projects with workforce, women can benefit from selling food to the labourers in the projects,” he observed. The Hoima-Tanga Pipeline which will pass through Kondoa District is set to create a number opportunities including employments and businesses to residents of Dodoma. Dr Mahenge informed the RCC meeting that every council earmarks ten per cent of the budget to empower youth and women economically and that the executives can help the groups to develop business proposals in connection to the ongoing development projects. He explained that the special programme to empower women and youth was introduced by the government to enable the groups engage income generating activities which would also create employments to other members of the public.
