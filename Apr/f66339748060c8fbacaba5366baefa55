At any level, this is a unique feature incomparable anywhere on the continent and beyond. Today, the majority of Tanzanians, 54 years old downward stand tall as Tanzanians born into a country known as Tanzania. But as we move forward - beyond half a century of our existence as Tanzanians - it is important to reflect on our past and present and what has happened in the intervening period, both locally and externally to prove the point that people everywhere are better off together; least of all Tanzanians. In the intervening period, a lot of water has passed under the bridge with the Union overcoming considerable tests poised by some separatist sections of the Tanzanian society. One way or another, some have pushed for a break up of the Union in favor of former colonial arrangements of a Tanganyika and Zanzibar. The pressure have come under different guises – most notably through recent constitutional debates – one in favor of a two-tier system of government with another pushing for a three-tier arrangement. As it will be recalled, the 4th Tanzanian Administration before the rise of the Magufuli Administration three years ago, initiated to re-write the Tanzanian Constitution. That sounded like building a new house. But one does not build a house without laying down a foundation stone. That translates for a leader of that initiative to show the way - taking into consideration the history of the country - including its landmarks, and what has thus far sustained the Union. Those landmarks should have featured both into the Constitution Commission and Constituent Assembly as it debated proposals for a new Constitution. Unfortunately, this did not happen as was evident both in the Constitutional Commission and the Constitutional Assembly, which seemed to push for a three-tier system of governance: that is a Zanzibar government, a Tanganyika government and a Union government! Clearly, one does not need to be a graduate in Political Science to read the implications of having more than two tiers of government. That would mean the wrecking of the United Republic of Tanzania itself! But fortunately, the rise of the Magufuli Administration and his focus on more pressing matters on the economic life of the country (making no flashback on the past debates on the Constitution) has minimized the risk of compromising our Union. Certainly, President Magufuli deserves commendation for ignoring this nuisance – working instead on the existing structure of government in place beyond half a century today. But pressures for an extra tier of government are bound to continue as we have separatists in place under the umbrella of some opposition political parties. But Tanzanians had better learn from paradigms elsewhere in this mutual world we share. Countries such as Tanzania’s former colonial power, the United Kingdom and even China have shown the way that people are always better off together. As for Britain, leaving aside its surprising recent move to leave the European Union famously dubbed “Brexit”, one would remember that notable vote about six years ago in Scotland (an integral part of the United Kingdom) which vote opted against separate nationhood away from the United Kingdom. That vote by Scottish people to opt to stay as part of the United Kingdom or Great Britain had set the agenda and opened the eyebrows of many people across the globe.Eh! Bwana! That vote had many people on their toes and was instructive to many globally as it was equally instructive to separatists everywhere. The win of the ‘NO” vote against separate Scottish nationhood in favor of British nationhood is instructive to comparatively young states in the developing world like Tanzania which were once British colonies – known then as Tanganyika and Zanzibar before the Union took place, resulting in the birth of the United Republic of Tanzania known today. Leaders of post independence Tanganyika, Mwalimu Nyerere and post Revolution Zanzibar, Abeid Karume had decided to unite the islands of Zanzibar and mainland Tanganyika to become a United Republic. Thus Tanzania became the chosen name for the new state. That was 54 years ago today, a shade more than half a century ago. To avoid the prospect of a bigger fish i.e. Tanganyika swallowing a smaller fish, Zanzibar, the two leaders, Nyerere and Karume decided then that Zanzibar should have its own government. When a contest was made to choose the right name for the two countries, the name, Tanzania, was chosen – thus the two countries were, hence forth, united into a United Republic, thus the United Republic of Tanzania. It was also agreed that there should be one Government for the United Republic of Tanzania that would absorb affairs of former Tanganyika (mainland Tanzania) and, within its umbrella, this would be an inclusive government that would have persons from Zanzibar sharing Cabinet positions and other public offices with their counterparts from the mainland in the government of the United Republic of Tanzania. This has been the stride of a Tanzania in the last half a century, and one can say with certitude that we have been better off this way together. There is another element from the Scottish vote about six years ago today that that had taken many people by surprise. I will tell you which one. Most people have always considered the British as one people. But the following remarks by the British Prime Minister then after the Scottish vote had enlightened me. Said he: “The people of Scotland have spoken. They have kept our country of four nations together…” He went ahead to name the four nations as: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. These are the ‘nations’ that constitute Great Britain or the United Kingdom - I came to realize reading the remarks of the British Prime Minister then. When, I for one, was attending the University of Wales, Cardiff in the early nineties - hardly did I know that I was in a Welsh nation – all I knew I was in Britain (Uingereza) - nothing more and nothing less! Nobody I met in Cardiff brooded anything like separating from the United Kingdom or declaring an independent state of Wales. So why should our former colonial masters consider themselves better off together as citizens of one Great Britain than us in Tanzania? As enticed elsewhere in this column, we have separatists here both on the island and mainland Tanzania. There are also political parties that have campaigned for a resurrection of a Tanganyika as much as there are people on the islands of Zanzibar who think they are better off outside the United Republic of Tanzania. Let us stick up to it to sustain our national unity and peace. makwaia@spicenet.co.tz
