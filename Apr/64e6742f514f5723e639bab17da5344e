NECTA Communications Officer, John Nchimbi said the extension runs starting April 1 and was due to the fact that many candidates had failed to meet the earlier deadline due to a number of reasons. “There will be no more extension after this given time, those who will fail they will have to register after paying the 65,000/-,” said Nchimbi. Adding that “Earlier the deadline was March 30, but there were a lot of requests for the extension therefore, we, thought it was wise to give them an extension. ” Last week when officiating the meeting for the Tanzania Managers, Owners of Non Government Schools and Colleges (TAMONGOSCO), the Minister for Education, Science, Technology and Vocational Training, Prof Joyce Ndalichako said knowing the number of candidates earlier, gives them chance to plan accordingly. She was reacting to TAMONGOSCO’s request that the registration time is too small for them to finish the job on time and called for extension. “The examinations are prepared taking into account a number of facts, including the number of candidates, subjects they will sit for and where, therefore, time is a key aspect,” said Prof Ndalichako.
