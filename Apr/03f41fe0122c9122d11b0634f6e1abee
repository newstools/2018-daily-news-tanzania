Speaking during FOCAC Alignment Workshop here yesterday, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Policy Advisor Laurence Mbwambo said there were “a number of opportunities and investment avenues” in environment , gas and oil and related sectors which could be tapped during the forum. “… that’s why we’ve decided to host almost 15 CSOs here … so together, we can plan and prioritize areas of mutual interest and submit them to the relevant authorities during the forum,” he said. He added bringing all these parties together would provide “an ideal avenue where CSOs can brainstorm and come up with issues to be submitted for discussion to the government so that at the end of the day, the country benefits from the forum”. Mr Mbwambo said they believed the CSOs who work closely with the public will be in a better position to know the need and area of interest as per investment and resource needed. “… we hope to equip the public with the knowledge on critical issues worth immediate attention … from which they can draw plans that match with available (investment) opportunities,” Mr Mbwambo said. On his part, the chairperson of the Northern Coalition for Extractives and Environment (NEEC), Mr Josiah Severre said the level of understanding of opportunities availed in such forum is still low and called for more public involvement. “If our people will not be aware of the opportunities available, then, we might be lagging behind as other countries tap them fully, thus involvement and educating our people is of paramount importance” said Mr Severre. Managing Director of Environment Media Agenda, Ms Sechelela Balisidya, insisted on the government to set its areas of priorities by involving all concerned parties to attain its goals. “We as CSO knows what we want and the government can have an audience with all its partners, us being amongst, so that we move together as a nation and benefit, taking into consideration the fact that, we are not the only one seeking for the opportunities” she said.
