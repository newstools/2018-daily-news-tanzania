The observation was made recently by Mara Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr Adam Malima, shortly after addressing senior government officials from Tanzania and Kenya in Tarime, during their joint technical meeting on reaffirmation of the border. “We have the same people living in the two countries, and what is being done is to put in place the foundations of peace, calm and maintain the existing good relationship,” he pointed out to the reporters in a brief interview after the meeting. However, he pointed out that he would give full cooperation to the officials entrusted with the work, adding: “We will provide sufficient cooperation to both teams from Tanzania and Kenya, and they must work together for this exercise to be successful.” Later, Mr Malima accompanied the officials in a long day tour of border’s sides in order to assess the real work on the ground, saying: “The reaffirmation and demarcation exercise would help to make the borders to be demarcated amicably and easily as it was in the colonial times.” The entire land boundary between the two countries is about 760 kilometres, but the first phase of the exercise is expected to cover 238 kilometres, stretching from the shore of Lake Victoria to Lake Natron. In another development, according to the Assistant Director of Surveys in the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development, Mr Huruma Lugalla, the first phase of the target of the reaffirmation and demarcation is expected to be completed by June this year.
