He said by submission of construction proposals, then NHC will be in a position to be a respective municipality with the construction cost and should they agree, then, the work will commence as per the contract. Mr Lukuvi was answering Mr Njalu Silanga (Itilima- CCM) who questioned if NHC can assist municipality with need of residential houses but they do not have enough financial muscle to handle the project on their own. “Immediately after NHC receives such proposal, they will work on the logistics as determining the actual cost, architectural drawings, land designs of a particular site and submit them to the respective customer for decision” he said. Mr Silanga wanted also to know if NHC has plans to construct residential houses in Simiyu region and its districts as the needs for the services are high. Responding, the Minister said NHC received the proposal in 2014 from Itilima District Council and June 2, 2015 they entered into an agreement to construct 14 houses. Of the houses, he said, 13 were meant for Head of Departments and one for the District Executive Director (DED) whereas , its construction was supposed to start immediately after the council reimburse an initial 400m/-. However, he said, the project has delayed to start as the council has not issued the initial installment as per the agreement for the construction to start. Mr Lukuvi commended councils of Momba, Busokelo, Mlele, Mvomero, Monduli, Uyui, Kongwa and Geita for facilitating their employees with residential houses constructed by NHC.
