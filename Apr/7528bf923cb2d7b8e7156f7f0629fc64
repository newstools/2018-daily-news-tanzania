According to Swissport financial results for the year ended 2017, lower production of the company’s key airline customers and loss of revenue for overstayed cargo contributed to the reduced number of flights handled. During the year under review, ground and cargo handling revenues decreased by 12 per cent and 8 per cent respectively resulting into 10 per cent fall of total revenue to 51.59bn/- from 57.50bn/- in 2016. However, the operating costs decreased by 4 per cent due to cost control initiatives implemented in the period under review. This includes an increase in amortisation costs to 1.17bn/-. Swissport future projection is not envisaged on a significant growth in volume of flights and cargo to be handled in the current financial year. “To retain our customers and remain competitive, we will be focusing on health and safety, enhancing the quality of the services to meet and exceed customers’ expectations, investing in new ground support equipment, warehouse infrastructure, technology and human resources. We are optimistic that the company’s financial performance in 2018 will remain stable and healthy,” stated the report.
