She gave the remarks here yesterday when closing a two-day seminar for the PIC members on capacity building on the roles and responsibility in overseeing investment matters in public institutions. “We believe you are now versed with your roles and powers as committee members, I believe you will guide the institutions effectively for the national economic growth especially on issues of investment and empowerment of the institutions” said the Deputy Speaker. Adding that “ At a certain point together with the Speaker, we realised that some committee bears a work load which does not fall under their powers, your committee is tasked to oversee increased productivity and investment in the public entities” She said so far the committee has visited 67 out of 270 entities within two years, thus, they should pick those which will give them a clear picture of the situation at present and offer the needed recommendations for having in place vibrant public institutions. The Committee Chairperson, Dr Raphael Chegeni thanked the Speaker’s office for facilitating the training as it has given members an audience the opportunity to understand their roles and responsibilities in the endeavors.
