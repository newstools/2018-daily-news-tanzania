Simiyu Regional Commissioner Anthony Mtaka revealed here that Simiyu has relied on Ward-based public secondary schools for years but now the area intends to establish three specialised educational institutions, to raise the academic profile of the new region -- recently hatched from Shinyanga. “We have started the construction of the first technical training biased secondary school in Bariadi at 350 million/- it will be known as Centred Boarding Technical School and will specifically cater for top performing students who will be sculptured for the upcoming industrial revolution age in Tanzania,” said Mr Mtaka. He was speaking in Arusha during the occasion to receive a cheque of 50 million/- from the Tanzania National Parks, whose Director General, Dr Allan Kijazi said was TANAPA’s contribution towards Simiyu’s regional education initiative. “This is just the beginning, we intend to assist Simiyu even further and they should expect the second contribution from us in the coming fiscal year 2018-2019 starting next July,” stated Dr Kijazi, explaining that TANAPA decided to make contributions to the region because it directly borders Serengeti National Park and the residents in the precinct have been helping in conservation efforts. Apart from the technical school, Mr Mtaka said his region will also build the proposed, Simiyu Boys and Simiyu Girls, secondary schools; modern learning institutions that will uplift Simiyu’s education status. “Last year we were 19th as far as National Examination Performance is concerned; this time we intend to lead the pack,” boasted Mtaka. The three secondary schools will feature 75 classrooms between them, laboratories, Home Science rooms, administration wings, dormitories as well as dinning or meeting halls, concrete fencing, matron rooms, staff housing and playgrounds.
