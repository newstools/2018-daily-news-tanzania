The Rukwa Regional Police Commander (RPC), Mr George Kyando, told the ‘Sunday News’ yesterday over the phone that the ban of disco for kids is still in place, adding that stern measures will be taken against those who will disobey the order. Equally, the RPC warned people against engaging themselves in activities bent on disrupting peace and security of the region. “The aim of intensifying the security is to make sure citizens together with their families celebrate Easter holidays happily and peacefully,” stressed Mr Kyando, who reminded parents and guardians to take good care of their children. “Parents who will go out with their children must make sure that they are well taken care of, especially in crowded areas,” said the RPC. He said the police force is well prepared and will be conducting patrols in churches, entertainment areas and all areas that are vulnerable, to ensure there is peace during the entire festive season. “Pedestrians, motor vehicles, ‘bodaboda’ operators and passengers should check against excessive drinking or walking carelessly while drunk to avoid accidents ... on top of that, drivers should make sure they park their motor vehicles in secure areas and lock their cars,” added the RPC. He further called on the public to provide the police with prompt reports of any suspicious activities
