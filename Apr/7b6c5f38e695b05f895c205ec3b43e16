Dubbed the Green X Prize, the platform identifies the development of smart, environmentally responsible technologies as a future global economic driver. "Green X Prize is about inspiring mindset to enable people to participate in the green economy. Green X Prize is for anyone concerned with solving an existing problem using clean energy and sustainable technology to preserve the planet and ensure a secure future for all the generations to come,” said Karabani Karabani, Green X East Africa Director. We envision a newly developed Tanzania no longer dependent upon aid and the benevolence of others, but one built on your dedication of self and country. This is your opportunity to help root out corruption, waste and mismanagement of public funds by building new systems that will prevent and bypass traditional orders that people have often depended on to develop and manage their societies. “Our platform taps into the creative minds of our country’s youth and young at heart with one mission in mind. Together, we want to revolutionize the way traditional social networks operate by breaking away from the practice of manipulating user data for profit," Green X Founder Thomas Addaquay expounded. Karabani encouraged Tanzanians to join the Green X Prize, an online community of like-minded global citizens interacting, and inspiring each other with access to a monthly $10,000 cash prize. Explaining more about the project, he said, the system is sustainable and it generates gains for all parties hence selection of winners will be conducted in the transparent manner Green X is arguing each one of you to sign up and submit ideas that will change Tanzania, vote, interact with other members, and hopefully win one of many monthly cash rewards to help bring your ideas to life.
