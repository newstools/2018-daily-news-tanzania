The concept was bringing together factories as well as other activities that look the same, connecting entrepreneurs’ skills and creativities and let others learn from them as well,” he said. The workshop was jointly organised by SIDO and the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH) in Manyara Region. Mr Mlay said that in order for the concept to work properly, people should set their goals as could as well be financial security, from there the groups put in concerted efforts in work so as to meet market demands that should have been already explored. He said the groups must have honesty leadership. “ It is pertinent to enhance the relations within the groups as without that success will not be achieved and competition will not be as it is required,” he said, adding that the concept in initiating such business was adopted from the developed countries that have areas divided and planned for production of respective goods. He singled out an examples of China on production of baby clothes; Kenya on still production, expounding that the governments have always been supporting them by acting as coordinators and at the end revenue authorities get their income while stakeholders acqure their profits.
