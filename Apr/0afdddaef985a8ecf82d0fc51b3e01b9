According to Deputy Commissioner of Police-in-Charge (DCP) of Special Police Operations, Liberatus Sabas, a totalarrested, 13 of whom have been taken to court. The police said 152 suspects were handed over to the Immigration department for further processes while nine were still under investigation and 194 were placed under police supervision. DCP Sabas mentioned the types of firearms seized as two Sub Machine Guns (SMGs), five pistols, one shortgun and 145 rounds of ammunition. According to police, some of the suspects are people who fled from Rufiji in the Coast Region and Kibiti in Lindi Region when police were conducting a special operation in response to killings masterminded by unknown individuals. “I order all individuals who fled from Rufiji and Kibiti to Mozambique to surrender themselves to police. We have information from impeccable sources that they fled to Mozambique,” DCP Sabas said. DCP Sabas said no stone would be left unturned until all individuals involved in the crime in the Coast and Lindi regions were brought to justice. He said criminals who fled to Mozambique were not safe either because similar operations were being conducted in the southern country. DCP Sabas said such special operations would continue to be carried out by involving other state security organs, asking the public to volunteer information to the police to protect people and property in the country. Recently, Inspector General of Police Simon Sirro met with his counterpart from Mozambique in Dar es Salaam to step up cooperation and curb crossborder crime.
