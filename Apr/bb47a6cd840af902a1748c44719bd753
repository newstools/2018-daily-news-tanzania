Ms Minja wanted to know the governmentâ€™s measures on strengthening the shilling value citing, particular case of some landlords who were still charging their clients in US dollars, thus contributing to shilling depreciation. Dr Kijaji said the other government initiative in strengthening the local currency was to limit unnecessary expenditures in foreign currencies. She said the use of foreign currency and the shilling in the country is regulated by The Foreign Exchange Act, 1992, Bank of Tanzania Act 2006 and the government notice of 2007 on the use of foreign currency to pay for goods and services in the domestic market. She said in December last year, the Minister for Finance and Planning issued the government notice directing all prices in the country to be pegged in shilling including school fees in various private schools, hotels accommodation, housing and office rentals
