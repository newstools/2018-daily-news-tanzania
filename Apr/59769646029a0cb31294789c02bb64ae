In a message relayed through the media in Dar es Salaam yesterday, TPDF says it had been established that the cheats operated largely through the agency of two groups. The army’s spokesperson, Colonel Ramadhani Dogoli, said a few of officers who had been exposed as part of the syndicate had been expelled from the army and faced legal measures. “This thing is hurting us. For the very few dishonest soldiers who were engaged in such conduct faced stern measures, including expulsion, but they could also be dragged to court,” Col Dogoli said at a press conference. He said apart from securing the country, the army was tasked to protect the citizens; and as such, it would not tolerate some soldiers becoming part of syndicates of conmen. He reminded the general public that the army was one of the government institutions that had clear procedures on recruitment, which he urged them to follow to avoid losing their money to conmen. He also reminded journalists to exercise the patriotic spirit whenever they wrote army-related stories, partly by verifying the information before publishing. The approach, he said was a safeguard against misleading the public, the repercussions of which could be serious. He noted that common errors in news stories included wrong names and ranks of officers.
