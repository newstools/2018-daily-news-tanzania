Resident Magistrate-in-Charge of the Dodoma District Court, Mr James Karayemaha, ordered Machibya to be taken to mental health facility in order to receive medication following the medical report. Machibya was in January ordered by the court to mental tests at the Dodoma-based Isanga Institute after the controversial preacher claimed that he had history of mental illness when he appeared before the court over suicide attempt. In his defence, Machibya said he had no idea that he had attempted suicide because he had mental problems and that he once attended Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam and the Moshi-based Mawenzi Hospital for medication.
