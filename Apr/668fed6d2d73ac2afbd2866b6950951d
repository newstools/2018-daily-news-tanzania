ASAS Dairies processes milk from smallholder dairy farmers in the four regions and has the capacity to process 50,000 litres a day. Mr Abri said the factory buys fresh milk from roughly 2,000 farmers and the number is growing. But, he added, bad roads are to blame for milk that gets sour before reaching the factory, making retrogressing government efforts to uplift farmers’ livelihoods. He named Busokelo in Mbeya Region as an area with promising dairy farmers, saying their milk is lost particularly during rainy seasons because of bad roads. “Roads in this area deserve special attention in order to raise the income of farmers and upgrade dairy farming,” Mr Abri said. He asked the government to formalise dairy farming because, he said, it is the kind of economic activity that can employ many people in the four regions and countrywide because of Tanzania’s big cattle population. Tanzania has the second largest livestock population in Africa, next to Ethiopia. ASAS Dairies, he explained, promotes small-scale holder farmers by giving them improved breed using artificial insemination, helping them access markets and training them. The company as a local investor was in January last year, described by Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa as an outstanding promoter of the local content concept. As of January last year, ASAS Dairies had 1,010 cattle, three (Igingilanyi, Nduli and Mgongo) farms with a total of 2,000 acres.
