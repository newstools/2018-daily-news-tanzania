According to him, the figures that were initially released by the office of the Chief Government Chemist that in Tanzania four out of six children that were subjected to DNA tests did not belong to their fathers. He gave the government’s clarification after Busega MP, Raphael Chegeni (CCM) pointed out that there was a ticking time bomb on the paternity issue in the country. “Honourable madam deputy speaker there are many men in the country who are forced to raise children who biologically do not belong to them. This is humiliating,’’ he said as MPs leaned on their seats laughing. However, Dr Ndugulile said it was not proper to quote DNA data from the chief government Chemist because they only represented a simple sample of people whose marriage wrangles led to the testing of the DNA. The deputy minister said paternity problems came as a result of paternity disputes that ought to result to compulsory DNA tests to solve them. However, Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly, Dr Tulia Ackson asked Mr Chegeni to calm down, as he cracked a jock by quoting a Kiswahili Proverb: ‘Kitanda Hakizai Haramu’ (Whatever is obtained on a bed is legal).
