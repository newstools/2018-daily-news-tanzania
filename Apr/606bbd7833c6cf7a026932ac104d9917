The new system has made it possible for the utility company to link its sales from various platforms including other phone companies and banks directly to GePG in line with government aspirations. Customers can expect an additional charge of 3 per cent on their LUKU unit purchases via M-Pesa as a result of this movement. Vodacom said in a statement that it will continue to offer LUKU services via the M-Pesa platform which is also available as an App via Apple’s App Store and Android’s Google Play. On March 27, Tanesco issued a statement on social media informing the public that as of April 2, 2018 it will migrate from LUKU to Government e-Payment Gateway as per requirement of public institutions. The notice which was issued by public relations office from Tanesco headquarters said that Tanesco being a government institution will start using this mode of payment to sell LUKU through its offices, mobile phone companies and banks. “The government with the assistance of Tanesco experts will ensure that the new mode will work without affecting the buying of electricity,” the statement read in part. The notice said that Tanesco joins other government institutions that have successfully migrated including the Police, the Business Registration and Licencing Agency (BRELA), the Ministry of Lands, the Tanzania Revenue Authority and the Water Authority.
