He said all tenants will be required to pay rent every month and not otherwise. “There have been this tendency of forcing tenants to pay rent annually, six or three months... this is unacceptable and the government will take stern measures against house owners daring to go against the instructions,” he said. The Minister was speaking during real estate exhibitions at Bunge grounds. The exhibitions were organised by Terranova Estate, Mwanamke Ardhi, Nabaki Afrika, Fumba Town Development, Alrais Development and Ngorongoro Conservation Authority.
