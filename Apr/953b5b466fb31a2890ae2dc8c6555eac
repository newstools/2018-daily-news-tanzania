On infrastructure, the Dar es Salaam police boss said some of the roads, including Morogoro, which was closed for the whole of Monday, are now passable . He said an assessment conducted using helicopters established serious damages on the infrastructure and asked parents and guardians to take care of their children, especially those residing in flood prone spots. Meanwhile, the Tanzania national Parks (TANAPA) suspended visits to Manyara National Park for some hours yesterday due to the ongoing downpours. The visitors were later allowed to continue with their journey at 2:00pm after the authority successfully rectified and restored the road infrastructure to Lake Manyara. Earlier, TANAPA Corporate Communication Manager Paschal Shelutete said in a statement that the visits were suspended after speeding water swept away the bridge at Marera River. “We welcome all tourists and other visitors to continue visiting Lake Manyara without any problem,” said Mr Shelutete after restoration of the bridge.
