Before Principal Resident Magistrate Thomas Simba, the senior official with the Authority denied the charges. The magistrate granted him bail having been assured by his advocate, Emmanuel Muga, to avail reliable sureties, who were ready to meet the set bail conditions. Kimaro was bailed out on conditions of securing two sureties, who were each required to sign bond of 200m/-. The magistrate also directed that every surety should deposit in court title deed of immovable property positioned in Dar es Salaam, which is certified at more than 200m/-. In addition, the accused person was ordered to surrender his passport or any travel document(s) to the court, and the magistrate also ordered that he should not leave the city of Dar es Salaam, unless he obtains permission from the court. The case was adjourned to May 3, when it will come up for mention. Investigations into the matter, according to the prosecution led by Principal State Attorney Vitalis Peter from the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB), have not been completed.
