A total of 402 sexual violence incidents against women and children were reported in the Indian Ocean semi-autonomous archipelago last year, according to the official data. “North Unguja recorded over 60 per cent of all reported incidents of sexual and gender-based violence and this is a very worrying situation,” Dr Omary Abdallah, Executive Director of Zanzibar National Arts Council, said over the weekend. He was speaking at a workshop organized by Tanzania Women Writers Association (TAMWA) Zanzibar, to explore the dynamics of child sexual abuse and discuss prevention strategies. The one-day workshop themed ‘Take action, stop sexual abuse in North Unguja’ brought together stakeholders who advocate for women and children’s rights. Rape cases topped the list with 87 incidents, while abduction came second with 80 (56 girls, 23 women and one boy were abducted). Other cases included defilement (14) and attempted rape (2). Unfortunately, only three suspects have so far been convicted, it was revealed. According to data made available at the workshop, the first quarter of 2018 recorded 40 sexual assault cases, only in North Unguja. Dr Abdallah said the sexual abuse of women, girls and boys had reached alarming levels and attributed the trend to modern technology, some aspects of which bred moral decadence. “We have adopted modern science and technology the wrong way, the development of science and technology has unfortunately accelerated moral decay instead of activating socio-economic development,” he said, adding: “Our people are increasingly embracing westernization in its totality at the expense of our indigenous culture and tradition and as a consequence, we are witnessing all sorts of social menace.”
