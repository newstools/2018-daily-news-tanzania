The team included the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development PS, Ms Dorothy Mwanyika, Home Affairs PS, Major General Projest Rwegasira, Ministry of Defence and National Service Acting PS, Mr Ndauka Eglibert and Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation, Regional and International PS, who was represented by the Africa Department Ambassador Director, Grace Juma. Their journey started at Sirari border where they inspected several pillars while being briefed on the progress of the exercise by the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development, Mr Isack Marwa on its progress. “We are ensuring that that the whole border is clear and visible and pillars are put at an interval of every 100 metres and they are many,” he pointed out to the delegation. The exercise is currently carried out in consultations with a team of senior surveyors from the two East African sister countries. Dr James Mtamakaya, the Director of Surveys and Mapping from the Ministry of Lands, Housings and Human Settlement said they started it at the Lake Victoria shore, adding: “This time we have targeted 238 km from Lake Victoria to Lake Natron and the work is expected to be completed by June 30 this year.” He further told the ‘Daily News’ that the delegation of the PSs will then visit Serengeti National Park (SENAPA) tomorrow with the similar mission. The entire land boundary between the two countries is about 760 kilometres, however, the first phase of the exercise is expected to cover 238 kilometres stretching from the shore of Lake Victoria to Lake Natron. Citizens of the two sister States residing along the border posts are being sensitized to be aware of the exercise and never try to tamper with the demarcations. Early this week, the Mara Regional Commissioner (RC) Mr Adam Malima inspected the same work on the ground and welcomed the initiative, saying that it would help to maintain the existing peace, security and order amongst the residents living on both sides of the countries
