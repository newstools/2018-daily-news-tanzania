The BBC describes the woman as "she was the matriarchal figure of a political dynasty that included two presidents - her husband George HW Bush and son George W Bush. " Mrs Bush, who was first lady from 1989 to 1993, had been in failing health for some time and had declined further medical treatment. Tributes to her poured in from across the US political establishment. Her husband, at 93, is the longest-lived US president. Their son, George, was elected in 2000 and served two terms as the nation's 43rd president. Source- BBC
