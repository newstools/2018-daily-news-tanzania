Zan Securities Limited Chief Executive Officer Mr Raphael Masumbuko said in Dar es Salaam yesterday that positive performance of companies in their operations is an incentive to investors at the equity market but poor performance discourages them. “There is a direct relationship between companies’ performances and share prices. When profitability falls, it directly affects their appetite to invest in the stocks,” he said. Similarly he said that the performance of the stock market is also affected by the companies’ earnings per share that may directly reduce investors’ appetite on the stocks. There are expectations for some stocks to gain this week as most companies will publish their financials. Mr Masumbuko said however that the poor performance of some listed stocks at the DSE is not peculiar to Tanzania but almost all stocks in the East African regions are experiencing the difficult situation. According to the weeklymarket analysis, the equity market recorded a turnover of 807m/- compared to last week’s turnover of 3.74bn/-, which is equivalent to a 78 per cent decrease.
