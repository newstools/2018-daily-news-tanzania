Rolling out the new vaccine at an official launch held in Dunga village, Unguja Central District in the Isles, First Lady Mama Mwanamwema Shein said the exercise was part of the country’s efforts towards prevention of cancer of the cervix that has caused great suffering and loss of many lives. “Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths among women in developing countries; let us go for it, “ Ms Mwanamwema emphasized at the colourful event attended by hundreds of teenagers and parents. The Minister of Health, Mr Hamad Rashid Mohamed, as well as Labour, Empowerment, Elderly, Youth, Women and Children Minister, Ms Maudline Castico, also urged members of the public to take the vaccination seriously, to protect girls against contracting Human Papilloma Virus infection (HPV) which causes cervical cancer. The World Health Organisation liaison officer in Zanzibar, Mr Ghirmay Andemichael, joined the authorities in encouraging people to embrace the vaccination, saying it had been proved safe. According to project manager Abdulhamid Ameir Saleh, cervical cancer was the second most common cancer among women worldwide, that was it estimated each year, there were approximately 528,000 new cases and more than 266,000 deaths from cervical cancer. He further remarked: “More than 85 percent of all new cases and deaths occur in less developed countries, partly because routine cervical cancer screening and treatment are not widely available. Zanzibar has also documented an increase in cancers, especially cervical and breast cancers and the trend is on the rise: 272 in 2015, 392 in 2016 and 560 cancer cases last year which include cervical cancer. ” He said cervical cancer was caused by the Human Papilloma Virus that was spread through sexual contact, warning that the main risk factors include underage sexual intercourse and multiple sexual partners as many men were unknowingly carriers of the virus.
