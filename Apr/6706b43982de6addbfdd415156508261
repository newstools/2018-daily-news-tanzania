The short term government note issued last Wednesday were performed poorly, fetching bids worth 154.9bn/- compared to 169bn/- offered to the market. This happened after almost nine months of outstanding performances due to falling yield rates. Orbit Securities General Manager Mr Juventus Simon said the undersubscription indicates that investors are looking for other opportunities like equity and corporate bonds for high return. “Investors goal is always to get return according to the organisation’s plan. For example, instead of investing in one year government note they can move to two years bond,” he said. However, apart from the undersubscription, the government retained only 117.7bn/-as successful amount. The BoT uses the short-term government note to mop excess liquidity in the circulation. Interest rates on the 364 tenure declined to 4.38 per cent from 5.09 per cent of the previous session. Yield rate on 182 days tenure declined to 2.96 per cent from 3.16 per cent preceding session. Weighted average yield declined to 9.28 per cent on the session held on Wednesday compared to 9.37 per cent held two weeks ago. Weighted average price for successful bid increased to 4.16 from 3.92 per cent the last sessions. The 364 days tenure attracted bids worth 137.2bn/-compared to 100bn/-offered to the market and at the end 100bn/-was retained as successful amount.
