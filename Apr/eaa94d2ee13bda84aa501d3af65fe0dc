He pointed out that, while criminal cases have dropped by remarkable margin, there is still the need to ensure that racketeers do not take advantage of the night cover to devise new vices or hound gullible travellers, but also the presence of the police on roads at night will help curb accidents of private vehicles that travel at twilight. “ Traffic offences are on escalation, for instance, between January and March, this year alone, there were 459,845 cases, compares with 413,218 cases reported within the same period last year, which marks an increase of 46,627 cases, calling for serious intervention,” said IGP Sirro. He said most of the traffic offences and even accidents nowadays occur at night because notorious motorists believe that, during the night, the coast is clear and police men have left their posts, so they tend to speed and take out faulty vehicles not worth for the road. He added that even drunken drivers usually come out at night.
