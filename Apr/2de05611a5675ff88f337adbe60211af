Speaking at the Tanzania Managers and Owners of Non-Government Schools and Colleges’ (TAMONGOSCO) meeting here yesterday, the Minister of Education, Science, Technology and Vocational Training, Prof Joyce Ndalichako said the move will help the government to set plans and effect constructive changes in the sector. Prof Ndalichako called on owners and managers to exercise patriotism when it comes to job opportunities by hiring qualified and competent Tanzanian teachers. “Be patriotic, you should not be used as a hide out for foreigners working without working permits, follow the rules but above all employ our competent and qualified teachers,” she advised. Prof Ndalichako, standing for the Prime Minister, Mr Kassim Majaliwa, said it’s in the interest of the government to work closely with the education sector as key stakeholders to improve quality and standards. But, Prof. Ndalichako said their claim that they encounter hitches from the government in their daily operations hardly qualify the situation on the ground. She admitted that there might be challenges but the government’s doors are wide open for consultations. “I know TAMONGSCO had many members but today the trend is different...this is a clear indication that your house is not in order, clear it, before pointing an accusing finger to the government,” she charged. Prof Ndalichako played down the request for employment of teachers from other East African countries for Tanzanian teachers to learn from them, saying: “We are highly competent in education, others should learn from us”. She said the government is working round the clock to address the challenges facing the education sector to ensure that schools and colleges are offering the best quality education. Earlier, acting TAMONGSCO Secretary General William Magero asked the government to consider revisiting taxes, which he said are contributing to high running costs, leading to high school fees.
