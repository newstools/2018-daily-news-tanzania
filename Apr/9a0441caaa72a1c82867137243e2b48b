The Vice-President, Latin America, Africa and Caribbean Sales, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Van Rex Gallard, said in a statement posted on the Boeing company website that they would provide an airplane of unmatched fuel efficiency and environmental performance, using 20 to 25 per cent less fuel and with 20 to 25 per cent fewer emissions than the airplanes it replaces. “I am pleased to welcome Air Tanzania as the newest member of the Dreamliner family. We are honoured that Air Tanzania has chosen the 787 to operate its long-haul operations,” he said. The government is expanding the fleet of national flag carrier, Air Tanzania Company Limited (ATCL) by buying new aircraft to revive the ailing airline and boost air transport and tourism, currently one of major foreign exchange earner. A new Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft arrived in Dar es Salaam last Tuesday to bring it to three the number of aircraft received so far for the state-owned airline. Other two Q400 turboprop airplanes were delivered in 2016 and are currently flying to destinations in Tanzania and Moroni. The government is waiting for delivery of other two CS300 jetliners from Canadian based Bombardier Inc later this year. Air Tanzania is expected to use its renewed fleet to begin long-haul flights to the United States, Europe and Asia, currently major tourist market to boost annual foreign visitor arrivals. The new Boeing 787 Dreamliner is expected to be used for long-haul operations, which significantly increase passenger numbers feeding on to domestic flights. The government has made the overhaul of ATCL, one of his flagship infrastructure development projects in a bid to transform the country into a regional transportation hub.
