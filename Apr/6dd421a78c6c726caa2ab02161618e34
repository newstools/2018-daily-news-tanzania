Despite yesterday’s morning heavy rains, the annual special prayers were successfully held at the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM)-Zanzibar main office, Kisiwandui area, where the late Karume was gunned down and buried. Clerics from Islam, Christian, and Hindu prayed for Karume, describing him as a great patriotic leader who should be honoured by serving leaders following his footsteps, mainly development strategies to move the country forward. President Ali Mohamed Shein, Union Vice-President Samia Suluhu Hassan, Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa, Second-Vice President Ambassador Seif Ali Iddi, Isles First Lady Mwanamwema Shein, and Widow Fatma Karume attended the prayers. Other attendees were the Minister for Foreign Affairs and East African Co-operation, Dr Augustine Mahiga, retired leaders: Mzee Ali Hassan Mwinyi (Union President) and Dr Aman Karume (Zanzibar President); representatives from foreign embassies and family members of the late Karume. Dr Shein and Mama Samia, also led others in placing wreaths on the late Karume’s grave at Kisiwandui where clerics put emphasis on “strengthening unity, love, and peace because they are the things that Karume left for us to uphold.” At the age of 67, late Abeid Karume was shot by one of his body guards on April 7, 1972 while playing ‘Bao game’, and he is widely remembered for working together with Nyerere to create the Union, and providing his people with three-acre land for farming, free education and health
