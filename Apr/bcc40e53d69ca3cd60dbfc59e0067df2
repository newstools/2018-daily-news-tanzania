Professor Emeritus is a designation given to a person of outstanding merit who had full professorial status before he retired, says UDOM’s Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Planning, Finance and Administration), Prof Ahmed Ame. “Prof Kikula is therefore eligible for the honourary title of Professor Emeritus due to his distinguished services to UDOM,” the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (DVC) told a recent event of Prof Kikula’s valediction which also saw the announcement of the title. Prof Kikula, whose tenure in the office as UDOM’s VC expired last month, had spearheaded the establishment of the University of Dodoma from the scratch, starting with 1,200 students in 2007. To date, the university has more than 25,000 students. Prof Ame said with the title of Professor Emeritus, Prof Kikula would now be able to take part in research projects at UDOM campus, pointing out the former UDOM Vice-Chancellor will be paid as per research project. When reached for a comment, Prof Kikula, noted that he was aware on the announcement of the title of Professor Emeritus, but he said he had not received official letter yet to inform him on the matter.“I’d be in good position to comment on the matter after receiving a letter from the university’s administration,” the former UDOM VC told the ‘Daily News’ Chairperson of UDOM Council, Ms Gaudentia Kabaka, hailed Prof Kikula for massive achievement at UDOM, saying UDOM started with one building at Chimwaga with the university area just a hilly jungle of shrubs. “Through his zeal and commitment, the jungle had been turned into a city of its own. His ten-year administration as Vice- Chancellor has left an indelible mark in the history of UDOM,” she said. Ms Kabaka said Prof Kikula with research interest on land resources management, has a remarkable research profile since 1975 to date, saying he has over 130 journal publications and reports.
