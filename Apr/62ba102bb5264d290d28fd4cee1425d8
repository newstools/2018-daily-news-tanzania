The self-declared NRM Kenya general was heard expressing his intention to sue Emirates Airlines for taking him back to Dubai against his will. Miguna was forced into a Dubai-bound plane by Kenyan authorities on March 28 after he was denied entry into the country. A court had ordered that he be facilitated to acquire a passport so as to attend hearings. On Sunday, the lawyer hailed what he termed “the professional and humane side of the United Arab Emirates exhibits itself.” This was after Sheikh Khalid, a senior government official, escorted him to get proper medical tests and treatment. He accused Kenyan police of “barbaric assault, torture and chemical poisoning.” In another development, Civil society groups have asked opposition leader Raila Odinga to abandon his agreement with President Uhuru Kenyatta because of Jubilee’s violation of human rights. Voicing concern over the deal signed on March 9, the social justice activists warned that such a pact makes no sense if the ruling party continues with its “well-trodden path of dictatorship, disregard of the rule of law and impunity.” Instead, they want Raila to cobble an alliance with civil society as the only viable option of continuing the struggle for reforms. “As such, the Civil Society Refernce Group calls on the former Prime Minister to tread carefully and not to hesitate to abandon the agreement altogether,” said the statement signed by CSRG presiding convener Suba Churchill.
