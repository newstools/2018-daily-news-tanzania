The Ministry’s Deputy Permanent Secretary Ambassador Yahya Simba said this recently here when closing a meeting that involved a committee for fighting human trafficking. The committee met in Morogoro to discuss and go through the 2015-2017 human trafficking strategy. It met to make some necessary changes to enable smooth implementation of the strategy in fighting human trafficking in and outside the country. He said the problem is big across the World and that approximately 700,000 people have been transported illegally from one place to another. “ Our fellow human beings are being sold like any other commodity in market. They are being used as slaves. We have some information that our country is also being used as a route for trafficking human beings. As a country we must strongly fight this illegal business,” he said. He said the government has given the matter a big priority and that measures are being taken to fight it. The representative of the International Organisation for migration (IOM), Enna Lutengano, said the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) statistics of 2012 show that 20.9 million people across the World are victims of human trafficking and that most of them are women and children.
