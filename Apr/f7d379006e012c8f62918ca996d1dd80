The share, according to the bourse data, opened the year at 1,140/- but gained by 38.6 per cent to 1,600/- on Wednesday. Zan Securities CEO Raphael Masumbuko said the investors anticipate that in coming future DSE would list more firms thus maximizing investment returns. “ Investors understand DSE will generate more revenue because the law stipulates that mobile phone and mining companies must list on the bourse,” Mr Masumbuko told ‘Daily News’ yesterday. The CEO said the demand will continue since investors are anticipating that DSE will grow toward the size of Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE). “DSE is walking towards NSE and means more dividend, capital gain and promising future,” Mr Masumbuko said. Currently DSE has 19 listed firms of which five are listed on alternative market while NSE has over 60 firms.
