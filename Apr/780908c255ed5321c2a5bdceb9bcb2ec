Tanzania State emblem comprises a warrior’s shield which bears a golden portion on the upper part followed underneath by the Flag of Tanzania. Below the Flag is a red colour which symbolises the rich fertile soil while the wavy bands represent the land, sea, lakes and coastlines. It was designed at Bwiru, Mwanza in 1961 by Jeremiah Wisdom Kabati and Francis Ngosha who died last year aged 86. “Mr Chairperson, I understand that we have our State emblem even here in the National Assembly, One is just ahead of your seat. Unfortunately the woman on the symbol is wearing a weave or rather she is not a native,” he said asking the Speaker’s guidance on the need to change the woman and replace with another woman who reflects Tanzanians women.
