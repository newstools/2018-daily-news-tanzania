Dr Tizeba was speaking with members of Kagera Cooperative Union (KCU1990) limited, Karagwe District Cooperative Union (KDCU) and Tanzania Coffee Board (TCB). The meeting, among other things, aimed at sorting out several issues including how KCU and KDCU would get funds for collecting coffee from villages during the 2018/19 crop season. “Coffee farmers have been restricted to sell their produce through the cooperative union system. Under the new system all farmers were required to sell their coffee through the cooperative unions in their areas. We are doing this basically to protect farmers and ensure that they are getting fair prices,” he said. Dr Tizeba noted with concern that he had received reports that about 9bn/- had been distributed by unnamed traders for buying coffee from farmers in Karagwe and Kyerwa districts. “This is economic sabotage … legal measures will be taken against any person going against the instructions,” he said. He directed the Cooperatives Registrar, Mr Tito Haule, to dissolve boards of three Agricultural and Marketing Cooperative Societies (AMCOS), namely Nguvu Kazi, Nkwenda and Mavuno. This follows complaints that the three AMCOS were collecting coffee direct from farmers in Kyerwa and Karagwe districts. Mr Haule, on his part, explained that the Tanzania Coffee Board will announce indicative prices for 2018/19 season, adding that there will be advance payments aimed to assisting coffee farmers when they wait when their coffee is taken to be auctioned in Moshi
