“I sincerely congratulate both Tanzania and the Ngorongoro National Conservation Authority Area on the important announcement that this area has been awarded the prestigious status of a ‘World Geo Park by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the first of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa and only the second on the African Continent,” stated Ambassador Charlie Stuart the EU Deputy Chief of Mission. Speaking during the global ‘World Heritage Day,’ held at the ‘Olduvai Gorge,’ which is the largest on site museum in East Africa, Mr Stuart said: “This award is a fabulous testimony to the efforts of those within the authorities, supported by funding from the European Union to assist with the extensive application process, who strived to make this happen.” UNESCO has just endorsed the Ngorongoro-Lengai Geo-Park which covers many geological sites including the active Mount Lengai, Lake Natron, Olduvai Gorge, Nasera Rock and parts of Monduli District landscapes. The European Union (EU) is funding the Geo-Park project, to the tune of 4.3 billion/- while the Chinese government recently injected 10 billion/- towards the new tourism site. The EU envoy said it was such a deserved award, to sit alongside the existing UNESCO World Heritage site at Ngorongoro and that the announcement from the United Nations’ body was timely, coinciding with International World Heritage Day 2018. Already, the positive effects are being felt and the European Union is so happy that its support for this area, for the restoration of this museum and for the award of the UNESCO World Geo Park status will boost the economy further. As I say, we are happy that the EU has been part of the efforts to build this museum, and more broadly support the conservation and promotion of the heritage of Ngorongoro. Our support has also extended in other regions across the country, including in Zanzibar, in the restoration and conservation of important cultural sites and monuments. Earlier on, Engineer Joshua Mwankunda, the Acting Manager for the NCAA Cultural Heritage Department explained that Ngorongoro was working to upgrade the road into hardened surface to ensure better accessibility and comfortable ride among visitors.
