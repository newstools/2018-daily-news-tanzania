Minister for Agriculture, Dr Charles Tizeba told reporters here over the weekend that he is also willing to share the plan with Ministers of State and Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa to help in resolving the matter that’s likely to tarnish the country’s image on international markets. “This is my plan. I will have to discuss with other ministers in the value chain to reach a general understanding,” he said at the meeting, also announcing that this year’s Nane Nane agribusiness exhibitions will be held for the first time in Simiyu region. The minister’s remark follows a recent report indicating that Tanzania cashew nuts which were exported to Vietnam had stones. The report was handed to the minister last month. He tasked his Permanent Secretary, Eng Mathew Mtigumwe to work with security organs to ensure all the perpetrators faced the wrath of the law. Tanzania is the largest East African country in export of raw cashew nuts to India and Vietnam. Official figures show that until February this year, the country had exported 190 tonnes out of the target of 230 tonnes during the current season. Dr Tizeba said he will be meeting with the Minister for Works, Transport and Communications, Prof Makame Mbarawa, Finance and Planning Minister, Dr Philip Mpango, Minister for Trade, Industry and Investment Charles Mwijage. He explained that the plan is to ensure all the cargo is tracked from point to point as well as being monitored throughout until it’s loaded on the ship. “This is the only way we can be safe,” he said. The report which was presented to the Minister in Dodoma contained names of state officials accused of sabotaging the cash crop.
