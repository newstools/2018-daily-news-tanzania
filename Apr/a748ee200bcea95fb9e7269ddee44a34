The MPs said the amount is too little compared to the current state of the economy in the country. Under Ward Tribunals Act No. 7 of 1988, the State established a council of elders for reconciliation, notably on matters involving marriage and land disputes and members are paid 5,000/- for every meeting. “For the past nine months, members of the jury at Kizuiani Primary Court have not been paid their allowances amid existence of a legislation that recognises their presence,” Mbagala MP Issa Mangungu (CCM) said in Parliament, yesterday. The MP wondered why the government had also failed to pay them every month and instead opted to foot the bills after every three month. Ukonga MP Mwita Waitara (Chadema) who also pushed for pay rise for the members of the jury was concerned that his area of 700,000 residents had no sufficient primary courts as required in government books. Ms Cesilia Pareso (Special Seat MP-Chadema) said the government needs to consider the time and role of elders in these courts and subsequently increase their allowances. Responding on behalf of the Constitution and Legal Affairs Minister, Prof Palamagamba Kabudi, Deputy Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister, Mr Anthony Mavunde admitted the money paid was insufficient “but that has been a result of budget deficit.”
