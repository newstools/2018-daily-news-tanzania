Ms Hassan warned that the unchecked and accelerated sand extraction posed huge threats to the Indian Ocean semi-autonomous archipelago, such as possible extinction of the Island. The VP made the remarks during a brief tour at Donge Chechele Quarry to assess environment impact caused by excessive extraction of sand, during day-three of her fourday tour of Unguja Island. “Climate change is really a threat facing our country and it’s largely caused by persistent environment degradation; you must bear in mind that we’re an Island, so if we keep ruining our environment like we are doing, we face a really danger,” she said. She was dismayed by the fact that mining operators were leaving behind huge pits, some going as deep as nine metres and apparently no one cared about the degraded environment. Ms Hassan warned about the consequences of severe land mining in the hinterland, saying it was causing land degradation and affecting the adjoining groundwater system, thus, leading to soil instability. “This can lead to a number of irrevocable effects including rise in sea level, increased vulnerability of environment such as weakening of land segments and that could lead to a possible sinking of this Island,” she cautioned. The VP said there was massive effects of mining activities in many parts of Zanzibar and went on to mention some of the most affected areas as Shakani and Bambi in Urban West. The Minister for Agriculture, Natural Resources, Livestock and Fisheries, Mr Rashid Ali Juma told the VP that the Donge Quarry, which is located 25 kilometres north of Stone Town, is the only current approved site for mining
