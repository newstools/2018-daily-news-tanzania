Speaking at the official opening of SADC liaison offices in DRC, Executive Secretary, Dr Stagomena Tax said the office will reinforce SADC support to member states and the organisation efforts in bringing out lasting peace and political stability in the DRC. She asked all stakeholders in the DRC to refrain from violence and find amicable ways of resolving their differences and create conducive environment for peaceful, free and credible elections in December 2018. “In recognising the efforts undertaken by the DRC and with a view to enhance our support to DRC, SADC decided to be closer to stakeholders in the DRC by among others, setting up a liaison office here,” she said. She added that the office will ensure SADC’s presence on the ground and continued support and engagement with stakeholders. She said among other things, the office will facilitate consultations with the DRC government, political and other key stakeholders in the DRC, consultation with the government to identify specific areas where SADC support is required to enhance political stability and sustained peace and security in the DRC. The office will ensure consultation with the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) and other electoral stakeholders support with a view to providing technical and logistical support as will be required in the preparations and conduct of the forthcoming elections.
