While the union goes much as a sociopolitical gain, in retrospect, sports have done a commendable job in cementing it. Even prior to the official union in 1964, sports have been actively unifying people of the now Tanzania Mainland and Zanzibar in terms of cricket, football, netball and hockey matches as well as the Easter Sports Festival have been there since colonial period. In Arusha, the well advertised Muungano Cup volleyball tournament has won handful fans to the extent that it seems to eclipse the Union Cup volleyball tournament on going in Zanzibar with top flight league teams from Tanzania Mainland and Isles aboard. Most often going by the name Muungano Cup, various sports have been engaged in the sports marathon staged to mark the union of people of the Mainland and the Isles. It is very motivating to see that there is an increase of sports from a football-netball domain when the two countries united in 1964 to multi-sports affair 54 years later today. Highly appreciated is the efforts by Tanzania Hockey Union(THA) whose tournaments; Mapinduzi and Union Cup have worked well as unifying among the factors. In their both tournaments teams from the Mainland and Isles are fully involved. Altogether, we would prefer to see events like Mapinduzi Cup, which is in recent years has become one the biggest club level tournaments in East Africa, get big support since unite Tanzanians and the whole of East Africa. The tournament, which previously drew only teams from the Mainland and Isles, has now ruled participation from Kenya and Uganda. All these sporting events need to be developed further since they are making us firmly united. As we urge Tanzania to value these sporting events, we would like to call upon business firms, individuals and government institution to support these events financially and materially so that they grow up to the higher levels
