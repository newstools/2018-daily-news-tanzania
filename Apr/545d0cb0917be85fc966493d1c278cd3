The event is focused on the improvement of the socio-economic conditions of the rural and urban areas of the country. The summit would be followed by Post Event Workshops on Islamic Insurance and Islamic Microfinance. More than 15 international speakers would give their contribution on the topics of discussion. Organiser of the event who is also the Chief Executive Officer AlHuda CIBE, Mr Zubair Mughal, said local banking and financial industry as well as the surrounding areas would participate in the conference to gain ample knowledge of the Islamic financial sector and solutions to the escalating problems of the society. “The event will be inaugurated by an esteemed chief guest from the ministry of finance. Participants are high profile personnel from 20 countries e.g. from central banks, banking and financial sectors of Tanzania and rest of the African countries, microfinance and insurance industry,” he said. He further said that today more than five in 10 Tanzanians 54 per cent are financially included, mainly through mobile money accounts 53 per cent. Tanzania has a large rural population, which makes access to financial services a challenge and digital solutions ideal. Mughal said the event is open for the public with very nominal entrance fee. It is highly recommended that more and more organisations, companies and banks join the summit in order to gain the maximum benefit from this international event in Tanzania.
