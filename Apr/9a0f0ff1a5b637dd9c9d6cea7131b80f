The recognition comes following a study that Socialbakers conducted from January to March this year. Airtel Tanzania Marketing Director, Isack Nchunda said the recognition means a lot to them and proves how committed they have been to their customers through timely responses via social media. “We are privileged to receive this recognition today and ours is a mission to ensure that Airtel customers receive timely responses to their queries. Social media has been one of the best platforms as through Face book, we have been able to reach our customers on time and ensure that their queries are addressed,” he said. A certificate presented to Airtel by Socialbakers indicated that the recognition came after the mobile phone company received a 98 per cent total response rate on Face book beating other mobile companies in Tanzania. He said social media platforms such as Facebook ought to be promoted highly as this will serve as an alternative to call centers and create multiple channel to reach to our customers and provide timely response. “Through social media, the response is instant and this is what has earned us this recognition this quarter as we were able to respond much faster to our fans and customers questions by 98 per cent,” he said.
