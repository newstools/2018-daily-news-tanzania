TBL Group safety and Health Manager, Khery Gunzarethy said in Dar es Salaam at the weekend that safety at work place is one of the TBL’s top priorities. “Safety is one of our top priority. Without safety there will be no efficiency. We are keen on safety issues and that is why we have a good record for winning award from Tanzania Occupational Health and Safety Agency (OSHA) and South Africa based National Occupational Safety Association (NOSA) which is an international organisation supervising safety at working places,” he said. As part of celebrating safety week 2018 at the working place, the new mobile application dubbed “Safety App” will enable its employees to immediately report any safety information via mobile phone. The celebration of the week went hand in hand with training of company employees on safety issues at the working place where workers working with Dar es Salaam, Mwanza Mbeya and Moshi plants benefited from the training. The manager said, because of special attention that is given to safety issues and procedures, the number of accidents at working places have been declining year after year as employees have all the knowledge and skills to take care of their safety and that of others.
