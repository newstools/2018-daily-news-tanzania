TBS Quality Control Officer, Deusdedith Maganga, said that samples of the goods were taken to TBS laboratory for testing and failed to meet standards set. “The importers of the substandard electrical products violated the procedures, since the agency has two systems of inspecting products quality standards inside and outside the country (Domestic and overseas inspection),” he said. He mentioned the procedures as the pre-export Verification of Conformity to Standards (PVoC) that involves inspecting the products before entering into the country. Mr Maganga said that the system has helped to eliminate disturbances to businessman as well as avoiding their products to undergo re –inspection procedure for the second time at the port.
