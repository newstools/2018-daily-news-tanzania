Speaker was forced to elaborate the matter, Thursday, when he was responding to MP Godbless Lema’s directive sought to know why Bunge is not authorizing cash for the treatment of outspoken MP Lissu in Brussels. Lissu was attacked in Dodoma by unknown assailants September, last year, and rushed to Nairobi, Kenya for treatments before being shifted to Belgium for further medication. Speaker said senior leaders of Opposition Chama cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo (CHADEMA) refused Lissu to have treated in the country and opted for Nairobi over Muhimbili National Hospital. According to Speaker,  in order Bunge to authorise release of cash  for the abroad treatment for Lissu and any other MPs, three documents that should be presented are letters from Muhimbili National Hospital, Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children and Presidential Permit. “Unless the three mentioned documents are submitted, Bunge will not sign a cheque for the treatment of an MP abroad,” Speaker Ndugai said.
