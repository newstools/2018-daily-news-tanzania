Speaking with reporters in Uganda, the TPA Director General said completion work of the railway line would open many business opportunities and facilitate the transportation train wagons once the ship docks at Port Bell. Ugandaâ€™s government is currently undertaking major repairs of the Port Bell - Kampala railway line as part of plans with Tanzania to revive a multi-modal transport route from Dar es Salaam port to Port Bell in Kampala through the use of trains and wagon ferry services. The revival is reportedly on top of agenda of Tanzania and Uganda bilateral relations after signing of a memorandum of understanding on joint cooperation for improvement of ports, Lake Victoria inland waterways and railway transport services. Tanzania and Uganda signed the joint cooperation agreement in mid-July last year for Uganda to use Dar es Salaam port as an alternative route to the sea through the central corridor. Tanzania agreed to build another railway ferry on Lake Victoria while Uganda was tasked among others to improve Port Bell and the meter railway line from Port Bell to Kampala. The two countries agreed that Uganda rehabilitates the Kampala-Port Bell railway line so as to facilitate the transportation train wagons once the ship docks at Port Bell. It has been proven that water transport combined with Railway transport are the cheapest means of transporting cargo compared to road transport. The cost of rail inter-modelled with water is seventy per cent the cost of the road. Uganda and Tanzania are eager to increase trade between themselves after it emerged that despite the good relations, there is little trade going on between the two.
