Officiating during one-day human rights stakeholders’ meeting in Longido recently, Mr Nguvila said empowered women are powerful beyond measures, imploring the Maasai society to educate girls for them to know their rights. “It’s high time Maasai women are empowered to own land, inherit livestock and even being the leaders of the community, if Longido is to achieve any meaningful developments,” he explained. Led by the local NGO, OIKOS East Africa, through a project dubbed investing in Maasai women, the human rights workshop attracted nearly 70 participants from all corners of Longido District in Arusha Region. The project, funded by European Union and launched in partnership with Maasai Pastoralists Foundation, TRIAS VZW and Marketplace Literacy Communities Trust, aims at improving the livelihood of 5,000 Maasai women in Arusha, Monduli and Longido districts. OIKOS East African Gender Advisor, Ms Esther Laly said the project targets the women in the areas due to the fact that they still lack formal education, basic human rights, have no political representation and rely entirely on subsistence informal economies, as a means to increase food security, reduce child mortality and mitigate social fragmentation. The action proposes integrated solutions with a multidisciplinary approach offering a wide range (technical, institutional, social) of skills and experiences aimed at increasing the productivity of vulnerable women, dependent on informal economy and living in harsh environments, strengthening their capacity to participate in regional policy processes which at present are virtually non-existent. “We will focus on generating sustainable market-driven development, to improve employability and establish incomegeneration activities among rural women, in three new sustainable business sectors: local and regional market of dried meat, honey production and the touristic sector in Northern Tanzania,” Ms Laly explained.
