Having lived through the third and fourth awamus of government, I think it is fair to take stock of our economic situation and to make a fair and informed assessment of what kind of policies are good for us. Tanzania has swung through both extremes of the pendulum. We have had times when even butcheries were actually state owned; don’t laugh, it is actually true. We have also gone through another phase whereby public banks and even the railways were privatized. There was the age of the Parastatal Sector Reform Commission (or was it committee?), PSRC. It could well be Parastatal Sector Selling Commission. It was a frenzy of selling to the private sector whatever could be taken off government hands. The only question that remains is who was the private sector? Some weeks ago president Trump of the United States talked about slapping tariffs on imported structural metals. This was protectionism in the real sense of the word. If the Americans, very smart people by any measure, or the American Industry needs protection from the ravages of a globalized economy what about us? Should not someone put a barrier and say toothpicks and kebab skewers should be locally made? That could even start the local growing of bamboo for these purposes and not only for ulanzi, a local brew. If we locals cannot start factories because of lack of technology or capital, then at least the government should step in and fill the gap with government owned factories and institutions. Does that sound like socialism? Yes it does. Is there anything wrong with socialism? Yes, there are a few drawbacks, general laxity for one. But are there no problems with capitalism? We have lived through it and one of the dangers has been the great disparities in the possession of wealth and in many cases the unfairness of the ways in which this wealth was acquired. It is a real threat to national peace and security. Business people will hate me for this but say we had a national mobile phone company that sold airtime at a competitive price because it had some technical advantage. If it had only ten million customers who paid only 300 Tshs. per day on airtime (talk time) and Tsh 200 per day on data; about Tsh 500 per day in total. 10,000,000 x 500 = 5,000,000,000. A gross of 5bn per day! The TRA would collect kiulaini… It is said that a government owned entity cannot be that profitable because Management would usually be lax with complete job security and all … I say hire a Mzungu or Mchina if necessary to run the Management but ownership to remain in the hands of the Government. The sun and the heat is killing us, especially in Dar. If I was the Government I would start a solar panel factory; get the taxes to all inputs close to zero and sell those things like hot cakes at the most competitive prices. The investment required for such a venture is well beyond the reach of most of even the rich Tanzanians. And if the rich Tanzanians had the money to invest in such a venture, they could easily make money on trading which is less demanding on management and technical issues. Such a project would keep the country very ‘green’ and the citizens would really and literally see the light. When are coal briquettes and gas going replace charcoal as a primary source of cooking fuel on a large scale if the Government does not put in a hand in a PPP, a Public Private Partnership? Again this ‘Private’ part of the PPP should somehow be made up of ‘empowered locals’. If, by the terms of the ‘current’ global gospel, it is really a sin for the Government to be involved in any business (The ‘Private Sector’ is the engine of growth!) then let us empower the ‘Private Sector’. The ‘private sector’ is unfortunately not me and you; it is investors from countries like China and India or multinationals and subsidiaries from Europe and America. If no deliberate steps are taken by relevant authorities to empower ‘locals’, ordinary folk will only participate in this ‘economic growth’ thing as customers and onlookers… Since we ordinary people have such little economic muscle, let our Government do it for us; Build companies like in the good old days of the National Development Corporation. Over the years, we have learnt something. I’m sure we will do better this time round. jvtndunguru@yahoo.com
