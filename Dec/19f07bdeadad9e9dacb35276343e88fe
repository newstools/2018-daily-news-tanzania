AUTHORITIES here are working on modalities targeting to save over 400 vulnerable children whose parents and caretakers perished in the MV Nyerere tragedy about three months ago. Apart from other forms of humanitarian assistance and psychosocial support provided by agencies, particularly in Ukara Island, a new problem has surfaced, calling for immediate intervention to rescue children living in a harsh environment. Psychosocial counsellors from the Tanzania Red Cross Society (TRCS) are camping in Ukerewe for over two months or various social support missions, working collaboratively with social officers from the Ukerewe District Council for possible remedial measures. Mwanza Regional Community Development Officer Mr Kizito Wambura told the ‘Daily News’ yesterday that the ongoing interventions were progressing well but challenges remained on a big number of children who lost their parents and who need to be rescued. “We are now working on the problem of children without proper parental care and thus living in vulnerable conditions in Ukerewe, and a number of interventions are in the pipeline to save them. We have contacted a number of agencies who have shown willingness to support us,” he said. He further revealed that a general assessment showed that more than 400 children lost their parents, expressing optimism that stakeholders and agencies would respond to calls for support. He mentioned some of them as SOS, Plan International and Railway Children Africa, while Pact Tanzania promised to chip in effectively early next year. Contacted for comment, the Ukerewe District Council Chairman, Mr George Nyamaha, said the situation had not been normalised, as some families were still being tortured by fresh memories of their beloved members who perished in the tragedy.
