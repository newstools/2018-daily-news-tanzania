ONLY 11 regions have active business councils that link the government officials and the private sector in discussion of pertinent issues on improving business and investment environment. Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office, Policy, Parliamentary Affairs, Labour, Employment, Youth and Disabled, Jenista Mhagama, said here yesterday that some regions formed the councils but failed to maintain them. The regions with active councils are Dodoma, Kigoma, Tanga, Geita, Morogoro, Shinyanga, Dar es Salaam, Coast, Iringa, Songwe and Mbeya. Ms Mhagama was speaking during her follow-up tour of the business councils’ activities in Kigoma region. She said the councils play an important role in accelerating growth of the private sector, which is the engine of economic growth. “We cannot just let the president to convene the National Business Council at the national level and fail to emulate him at the regional and district levels,” she fumed, directing all regional governments to stablish the councils.  The minister directed all regions, through the invigorated business councils, to meet and sort out challenges facing the businesspeople and investors at their respective regions and districts. The deliberations will also help to identify and market available investment opportunities. Kigoma Regional Commissioner, Brigadier General (Rtd) Emmanuel Maganga, Kigoma District Commissioner, Samson Anga and Regional Administrative Secretary, Rashid Mchata said they have enhanced dialogue between the government and the private sector through the business councils at regional and district levels. The Programme Coordinator, Mr Andrew Mhina said the programme, aims at improving business and investment environment in the country. Through collaboration with the National Business Council, the region has prepared the guidelines for the dialogue between the government and private sector at the regional and district levels.
