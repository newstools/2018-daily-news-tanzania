RECOGNITION of petty traders, commonly known as ‘machinga’ is one of major steps in building up an inclusive economy by allowing majority Tanzanians to engage in economic growth without problems. University of Dar es Salaam lecturer Professor Milline Mbonile, speaking at a professorial inaugural lecture, “uprooted and marginalised people in Tanzania”, said that some people, including ‘machinga’ are forced by some factors to leave their homes to become petty traders. He said the idea comes as a solution to their survival, “These people find themselves in a challenging environment and decide to do whatever they could to earn a living.” However, Prof Mbonile said machinga have been considered as trouble makers and that the recent measure to recognise them by identity cards means a lot to them. “For years, these people have been playing cat-rat games, where machinga feel denied by their own society, therefore the idea of IDs is crucial for the business growth,” he noted. Prof Mbonile who is expert in Migration research was reviewing the situation of internal displaced people (IDPs). He cited some reasons behind rural-urban migration as violence against children, poverty and search of green pastures. He asked the government, religious institutions and other stakeholders to join hands in supporting whoever is struggling to use legal means in improving their lives.
