THE National Environment Management Council (NEMC) yesterday condemned laxity on waste disposal and called on local governments to use statutory powers to deal with culprits in order to protect Tanzania’s environment. The council also called for concerted efforts towards waste recycling. The Council’s Director General, Dr Samuel Mafwenga said section 19- 10 of the Environment Management Act, 2004 prohibits irresponsible disposal of any kind of waste on the environment in Tanzania, especially dumping of toxic fine powder, chemicals, oil or oily compounds in water sources or any form of water stream or water body. Speaking shortly after touring Mbezi Beach ‘A’ area in Dar es Salaam to inspect the River Mbezi, the new NEMC boss said the police force through its Environmental Section and the local government will work together to enforce the law. “Culprits should be punished under this law, and the punishment must include bearing costs of removing the dumped wastes, restoration of environment to its original state and due compensation,” he warned, adding that under section 135( 2)(3) of Environment Management Act, any generator of harmful waste should be held responsible for any harm caused to people, creatures and the environment. The council called on boards responsible for management of water basins and catchments to save water resources from contamination by using the Water Resources Management Act of 2009. Speaking at the same occasion, the Police in-charge of Environment Unit, Assistant Commissioner of Police, ACP Edward Belele said the police have taken the order seriously and that the law will be enforced.
