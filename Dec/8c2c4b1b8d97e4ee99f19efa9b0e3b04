The Kenyan High Court has declined to grant divorce to a couple ruling that reasons presented to prompt their split was minor. The wife complained she wanted more children, but the man didn't, something she can't continue bearing. The couple has been married for eight years and succeeded to get only one child. Justice George Dulu said the quarrels the couple had weren't serious so they should go home and solve them. He also advised the couple, married under Islamic law, to seek reconciliation from their religious leaders and family elders.
