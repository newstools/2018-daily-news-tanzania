PRIME Minister (PM), Kassim Majaliwa is set to launch the new tourism channel dubbed Tanzania Safari Channel tomorrow. The Channel was initiated with the collaboration of Tanzania Broadcasting Corporation (TBC) and other tourism stake holders including Tanzania National Parks (TANAPA), Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority (NCAA) and Tanzania Tourist Board (TTB), which will start airing pilot programmes starting from the day of the launch. “The idea was there, but the visit by President John Magufuli to our station at Mikocheni in Dar es Salaam last year became a catalyst motivating us to start the ball rolling,” commented Director General of TBC, Dr Ayoub Ryoba yesterday during a press conference. The aim of the channel is to broadcast and advertise tourist attraction centres in the country. “It will start by being aired through StarTimes using Swahili the national language. “It will be aired later through DTT (Digital Terrestrial Television) and Satellite channels and the languages used will be added as well,” he said. Initially, the channel will be from TBC station in Dar es Salaam and later shifted to Dodoma which will become the station headquarters. “We expect the programme content to be exhaustive of the sector and new every day with the desired standards of production,” he affirmed. Tourism is not about wild life alone, it is a wide sector that also including various historical, cultural, geographic structures, perspectives as well. The channel is expected to bring global awareness on tourist sites found in the country. The initiative will also put an emphasis on preserving the environment especially those surrounding the tourist attraction sites, Dr Ryoba said. TTB Managing Director, Ms Devota Mdachi said currently the sector received over two million local and international tourists a year.
