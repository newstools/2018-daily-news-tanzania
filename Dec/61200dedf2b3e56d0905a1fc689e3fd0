RUKWA Regional Commissioner Joachim Wangabo has warned that fund allocated for construction of Kalambo district hospital will be returned to the central government unless the residents resolved their dispute. He said the government has already provided 1.5bn/- for the district hospital construction but the ongoing dispute on the facility’s location is alarming. Mr Wangabo asked the residents to resolve the matter before January 2019 or else the money will be resent to the central government for other use. All the three districts in Rukwa Region have no hospitals. However, the regional authority has recently released 4.5bn/- for the hospital construction, the RC said during his tour of Kalamabo District, sounding the warning. During the tour, the RC realised that some people who reside near the proposed area for the project demand compensation before paving way for the project. Mr Wangabo reminded Kalambo district leadership that as per Ministry of State, Regional Administration and Local Government (Tamisemi) directives no compensation will be paid. “Only few days have remained for the construction of district health facility to take off officially ... so if the dispute continues, we are not going to delay this matter instead, the government will take the money and put it to other uses,” he noted.
