AS Kiswahili language gains momentum globally, President Ali Mohamed Shein yesterday reiterated his call on Tanzanians to make the best use of emerging opportunities in Kiswahili, including many universities around the world currently teaching it. In a speech while gracing the opening of ‘the 2nd International Kiswahili forum’ organised by Kiswahili Council of Zanzibar- BAKIZA, Dr Shein encouraged the use of standard Kiswahili and conduct that will protect the language. “Let us follow the footsteps of our nation’s founding fathers, Mwalimu Nyerere and Karume, who valued Kiswahili and used it to unite us. It is now our role to promote and love it,” the President said at the forum held at ‘Idrissa Abdulwakil Hall’, Stone Town. The gathering attracted academicians, students, writers and publishers of Kiswahili books and other publications from many countries, including United Kingdom and the United States, with some African countries such as Rwanda and South Africa already taking measures to promote the language among its citizens. He said President Nyerere first used Kiswahili to open the first union parliament in 1962 shortly after independence, while the late Karume declared Kiswahili as the official language in 1964 after the revolution.
