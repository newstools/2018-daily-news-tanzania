DAR ES SALAAM Stock Exchange (DSE) has clutched to bearish mode as investors’ cash their stocks for Christmas and New Year spending. The trend was exhibited Tuesday when the bearish trend continued pushing equity prices and market capitalization further south. The DSE on Tuesday recorded a total turnover drop of 720,575/- against 269.28m/- posted on Monday. Solomon Stockbrokers said yesterday in a statement that the exchange trading was dominated by local investors. “The total turnover of shares bought and sold was led by local investors by 100 per cent,” the stock brokerage firm said in its daily Market Report. The report showed that the number of share exchanged hands 2,070 compared to 22,920 shares traded on Monday. Orbit Securities said in its Weekly Synopsis that the domestic bearish movement during the week was a result of two domestic counters shedding prices. “DSE was still bearish (last) week as we enter the festive season due to investors’ preference of liquidity for festivals consumption,” Orbit said. Last week the domestic market capitalisation slightly lost 0.32 per cent to close at a 9,701.24bn/- from previous 9,732.13bn/-. As a result the Tanzania Share Index (TSI) lost 11.76 points to close last week at 3,693.30 points.
