PRESIDENT John Magufuli yesterday expressed dissatisfaction with the Tanzania Revenue Authority’s (TRA) performance on collecting revenues, saying the amount collected does not match with the actual population of Tanzanians. He asked TRA to pull up its socks by charting strategies for increasing revenue. The Head of State was speaking during a meeting that brought together TRA officials across the country, Regional Commissioners (RCs), Regional Administrative Secretaries (RASs), heads of various government agencies, and some ministers. President Magufuli said TRA needs to increase the number of taxpayers, create a good environment for people to do business and demonstrate fairness when estimating and collecting taxes from traders. “Our country’s population is now 55 million people but only 2.5 million of them pay tax, which gives a proportion of 12.8 per cent of GDP,” he said. The Head of State said Tanzania was still lagging behind less populated African countries. He said Kenya, which had a pupulation 46.6 million, has a total of 3.9million taxpayers and the proportion to GDP is 18.5 per cent. He added that Rwanda had 11.6 million people, of whom 172, are taxpayers; Uganda has 37.7million people and it has 1.3 taxpayers while Burundi, which has 10.4 million people has 22,291 taxpayers and the GDP proportion is 13 per cent. The Head of State added that South Africa had 56.52 million people, of whom 19.9million were taxpayers. Botswana has 2.2 million people and 734,470 of them are taxpayers, Mozambique has 27 million people and 5.3 million of them are taxpayers while Namibia, which has a population of 2.3 million people. has 665,763 taxpayers. “The tax-base is still poor.There must be somewhere we have failed in revenue collection. There are also still loopholes of tax evasion for some traders as there are companies which declare to have been operating at a loss every year so as to evade taxes. I am aware that these companies collaborate with some dishonest TRA staff who advised them to close businesses and re-open them afresh in other areas,” said President Magufuli. The Head of State advised TRA to set high targets as other countries do. He cited Kenya as an example, saying in 2013/14, the authority there targeted to collect 9.74bn US dollars and managed to collect 9.64bn US dollars. He said during the same period, Tanzania targeted 4.8bn US dollars and managed to collect 4.4bn US dollars. He further explained that in 2017/18, Kenya targeted 15.4bn US dollars and managed to collect 14.3bn US dollars while Tanzania set a target of 7.67bn US dollars but collected only 6.8bn US dollars. He stressed that, despite an increase in revenue collection from 850bn/- in previous years to 1.3tr/- in the past three years, the tax-base was still poor. The Head of State added that the problem was also on non-tax levies collection, saying despite an increase from 284bn/- collection in 2010/11 to 2.2 tr/- in 2012/18, the amount was still down compared to the available resources. The President also cited existence of non-registered ports in various parts of the country as among barriers towards tax collections. President Magufuli said 74.5 bn/- property tax collected in the past three years from only 1.6 million properties (houses) that are registered is not enough compared to the population of 55 million people.
