TANZANIA Health Summit (THS) in collaboration with Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute (JKCI) and Save the Children Tanzania has prepared Heart Marathon 2019 in a bid to motivate and put an emphasis in combating non-communicable diseases. It also aims to add efforts to the government to fight against such diseases. Thousands of runners and cyclists with their families and friends are expected to join efforts to fight and raise community awareness on the current alarming increase in preventable chronic diseases like blood pressure, diabetes, heart diseases, cancers, and stroke. It is 21km half marathon which will take place on April 28th next year near Coco Beach grounds. The run has no limit on the number of participants and there is no cut off time, therefore attracting fast runners as well as walkers and cyclists. To register for the marathon, participants are asked to follow the website www. heartmarathon.com which provides detailed information. Running the Heart Marathon is a stepping stone for a change in personal attitude towards life style related disease as well as having a fun run with colleagues said THS President Omary Chillo during the launch in Dar es Salaam yesterday. “The marathon themed ‘run for every heart’ is also committed to raise funds to support children with heart diseases at JKCI,” he stated.
