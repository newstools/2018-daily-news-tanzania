A MEMORANDUM of Understanding (MoU) is set to be signed between the Ministry of Land, Water, Energy and Environment of the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar to facilitate cooperation between the two sides. Speaking to the ‘Daily News’ here yesterday, the Deputy Permanent Secretary in the Water Ministry, Engineer Emmanuel Kalobelo, , noted that since the water sector was not in the Union affairs category, the MoU would enable the two parts to share experiences and knowledge in order to improve the sector. “The main goal of MoU is to improve water supply services to the people in both parts of union,” said the deputy permanent secretary while briefing this newspaper on a meeting with his Zanzibar counterpart, Mr Tahir Abdullah, on Tuesday. Eng Kalobelo said the meeting was aimed at developing guidelines for a MoU for the two parts of Union, saying the guidelines would be submitted to the permanent secretaries of both parts in the Union early next year for improvement prior to be presented to permanent secretaries. “The guidelines will be submitted to the permanent secretaries in both parts of the Union for official signing of the MoU,” he said. Eng Kalobelo cited the benefits in the MoU as water experts from both parts of the union to visit water infrastructure and convene joint meetings to discuss issues pertaining to the water sector. He noted that the MoU to be signed early next year is part of implementation of directives issued by the Vice-President Office which encourages ministries from both parts responsible for issues which are not in the Union matters category, to convene joint meetings in order to share experience to improve the Union. “The joint meetings provide executives from both Union parts with a platform to share experiences in policies, laws and expertise in order to address a number of challenges in the water sector in the country,” said the Deputy Permanent Secretary.
