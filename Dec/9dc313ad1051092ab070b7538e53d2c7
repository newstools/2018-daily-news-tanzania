MINISTER for Information, Culture, Arts and Sports Harrison Mwakyembe said he is ready to abandon his working place Dodoma and camp in Dar es Salaam to speed up the 2019 Under-17 Africa Youth Finals (AYC) preparations. Seven countries in Africa will join hosts Tanzania for the biggest continental youth showpiece whose draw is set to be conducted this month in Dar es Salaam. “Until now, we have already identified two venues which are JMK Youth Park and Dar es Salaam Gymkhana Club (DGC) ground to be used for training sessions by the competing teams and owners of these facilities have been told to keep them clean ahead of the approaching games,” Mwakyembe said. He added that from next week, he will be on the ground himself facilitating the whole exercise of renovations such that when the special team from CAF and FIFA comes again for final assessment, they should find everything in order. He continued: “I will be travelling with you guys (members of media) to see for yourself the progress of upgrading works so that you can update the nation on what is going on.” “I am pleased with the level of cooperation from the immigration Department, who usually attend our meetings since they are also very important to ensure that visitors do not stay for long time at the airport,” Mwakyembe said.
