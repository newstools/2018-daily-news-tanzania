According to the RPC, most drivers were arrested for failure to observe speed limit signs, overloading and driving buses with technical problems. “ I led the operation myself from Iyovu area to Ruaha Mbuyuni; this is one of the most accidentprone areas; we have arrested these drivers for various reasons, but most of them are reckless and don’tobserve traffic rules,” he said, adding: “The area has sharp corners and hills that do not allow drivers to see the other side easily, but most of them dare to overtake each other and end up causing fatal accidents,” he remarked. The RPC said his office would conduct periodic operations through the traffic department to ensure that all drivers adhered to the rules and regulations as required by law. “We are looking forward to conducting patrols in all areas; drivers have to choose between adherence to the law or face sanctions,” he remarked.
