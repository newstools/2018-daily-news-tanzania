Manchester United have confirmed today (Tuesday) that they sacked Jose Mourinho as manager after two and a half years in charge at Old Trafford. The flamboyant manager, 55, guided United to League Cup and Europa League titles. Currently, the historical EPL title winners are sixth in the Premier League, 19 points behind leaders Liverpool, who beat them 3-1 on Sunday. "A caretaker-manager will be appointed until the end of the season while the club conducts a thorough recruitment process for a new, full-time manager," United said in a statement. "The club would like to thank Jose for his work during his time at Manchester United and to wish him success in the future," BBC quoted the clubâ€™s statement. BBC report that the caretaker-manager to replace sacked Mourinho who covered the vacuum left by Louis van Gaal in May 2016, will not be assistant coach Michael Carrick or academy boss Nicky Butt. The candidate will be drawn from outside the club, but will not be former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger.
