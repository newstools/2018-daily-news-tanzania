MINISTER for Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development, William Lukuvi has urged Tanzanians to make sure they possess national Identities (IDs) so that it could be easier for officials from his ministry to process electronic title deeds for them. The minister was addressing Ilala district residents on Monday regarding resolving various issues related to land conflicts. “The IDs are very crucial in this exercise to avoid any kind of forgery, some individuals use names of the dead people, which is unacceptable,” he said . He said the names on title deeds must be the same as the ones on the National Identification Authority (NIDA) database. According to him, the government made it easier for everyone to have a title deed which will be obtained by paying 250,000/-. “Those whose title deeds were not electronically processed must also have the IDs and change the documents,” said Minister Lukuvi. On property tax, Mr Lukuvi reminded house owners to immediately fulfil their responsibilities, saying those who will fail to comply by June, 2019 will have their properties auctioned. During the meeting, trespassing-related cases and double allocations were raised as well as delaying in issuance of title deeds by the municipal officials. Minister Lukuvi directed the District Commissioner’s office and municipal councils to visit all people who have lodged land disputes in order to find a lasting solution to the matter. Earlier, Dar es Salaam Regional Commissioner, Mr Paul Makonda revealed that there were over 4720 land-related disputes that have been lodged in his office.
