People in the Democratic Republic of Congo are voting for a new president in an election delayed for more than two years. Close to 40 million people are eligible to vote for a successor to President Joseph Kabila - in power since 2001. But the run-up has been hit by violence and controversy over the decision to exclude some 1.26 million from voting. The poll is expected to bring the country's first peaceful transfer of power since independence in 1960. On Saturday, however, rival candidates failed to agree on a statement aimed at reducing tension before the poll. Voting began at 05:00 (04:00 GMT) and ends at 17:00.
