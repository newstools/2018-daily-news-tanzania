IN light of the youth’s contribution to Tanzania’s industrial economy agenda, the government is reviewing the National Youth Development Policy, 2007. Speaking at the weekend, Youth Development Director in the Prime Minister’s Office James Kajugusi said the new national policy would encourage more young people to engage in the industrial economy. “The aim of the review is to provide the ministries responsible for industries and agriculture with a framework that will facilitate the involvement of young people in developing programmes on industries, agriculture and fisheries,” he said during a youth meeting. The youth meeting, which was organised by the Prime Minister’s Office, brought together the youth working from various sectors of the economy to deliberate on the final draft of the National Youth Development Policy before presented to the Cabinet for endorsement. Mr Kajugusi explained that under the new National Youth Development Policy, the youth would be involved in development programmes developed by the ministries of Industry, Trade and Investment and Agriculture and Livestock. “It will encourage the youth to take part in agricultural activities in order to provide industries with raw materials,” he noted. Mr Kajugusi pointed out that the review of the National Youth Development Policy would also provide the youth with a framework to help cope with current changes in the advancement of science and technology. “The new policy intends to encourage the youth to utilise ICT and social media networks for economic development,” he added. Ms Mary Kessy, one of the youths, who took part in the youth meeting, expressed delight in the review of the National Youth Development Policy, saying it would address challenges facing the youth in the country. “We are grateful to the government for giving us an opportunity to give our views on the new National Youth Development Policy,” she noted.
