THE Kisutu Resident Magistratesâ€™ Court in Dar es Salaam has failed to deliver judgment on an economic sabotage and abuse of power case facing veteran journalist Tido Mhando. Based on that, the magistrate adjourned the case until January 25, next year, when it will deliver judgement. Principal Resident Magistrate Huruma Shaidi told the court that he was still working on some pending issues before he could deliver the judgment. Earlier on, Senior State Attorney Nassoro Katuga informed the court that the case had appeared for judgement. Mr Mhando faces four counts of abuse of power, which caused a loss of 887m/- to the government. It was alleged that, while in Dubai, UAE, on June 16, 2008, Mr Mhando, who was by then TBC Director General, misused his authority by signing a contract on TV programmes between TBC and Channel 2 Group Corporation without a tendering process. On the second count, Mr Mhando is accused of having abused office on June 20, 2008 after signing a contract between TBC and BV1. On the third count, it is alleged that between August 11 and September 2008, while in Dubai, Mr Tido abused office by signing a contract to purchase, distribute and install communication towers to TBC in favour of BV1. On the fourth count, it is alleged that on November 16, 2008, while in Dubai, Mr Mhando abused office by signing a contract of managing TBC broadcasting infrastructure in favour of BV1.
