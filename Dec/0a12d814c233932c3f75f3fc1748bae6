TANZANIA Standard (Newspapers) Limited (TSN) yesterday announced journalist Alfred Lasteck as its best employee of the month of November. A new programme involves recognising one employee for achieving excellence and being the best worker with the aim of encouraging others to be more productive. Mr Lasteck, who works with SpotiLeo and HabariLeo, was announced as the best employee of the month nominated by his supervisor for his investigative story he worked on for about six months in Kariakoo, Dar es Salaam, on how traders were evading tax. TSN Acting Managing Editor, Boniface Mwajombe said Lasteck pursued the investigative story on his own without any assistance from the company. “He did not wait for the editor to hand him the assignment and that is what we want for someone to unearth burning issues in the community for the benefit of the government, society and the company,” he noted. According to Mr Mwajombe, few weeks after the story was published Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) and Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) started following up the matter. For her part, TSN Human Resources Manager, Hawa Mniga said apart from motivating an employee, same procedures would be used to get the best employee of the year on Workers Day among those, who had emerged winners each month. Mr Lasteck expressed his gratitude to TSN and staff members for the cooperation he received, when pursuing his story and recognising his contribution to the company, members of the public and the government. During an event that lasted for about 20 minutes, he was awarded a certificate and cash money.
