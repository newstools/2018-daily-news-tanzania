THE University of Dodoma (Udom) will host the much anticipated 11th Eastern Africa University Games (EAUG), which bring together universities from East Africa to compete in various games. Udom Acting Vice Chancellor, Prof Peter Msoffe, noted at the weekend that at least 50 universities from Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, South Sudan, Tanzania and Zambia had confirmed to participate in the annual event scheduled for kicking off today at Udom grounds. “Zambia has requested to take part in this year’s edition of EAUG as a guest nation to learn how to organise the competition,” said the acting Vice Chancellor, who doubles as co-chairperson of the EAUG organising committee. The annual event, which is jointly organised by Eastern Africa University Sports Federation (EAUSF) and Tanzania University Sports Association (TUSA), takes place at Udom campus for the first time. Prof Msoffe pointed out Tanzania would utilise this year’s competition under the theme ‘University Sports Promote Tourism Development in East Africa’ to promote tourist attractions in the country. “While here, our guests will get an opportunity to visit tourist attractions near our region, including Tarangire, Manyara, Ruaha and Mikumi,” he said. Prof Msoffe noted that preparations for the EAUG, whose opening would be graced by Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa, were in progress, noting that Udom boasts of enough sports facilities on its main campus. He urged residents of Dodoma to utilise the opportunity of games taking place in the capital city to generate income through various businesses.
