THE government has received €3.25m (9.4bn/-) from the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), which is a contribution from Germany to support refugees and asylum seekers in Tanzania. “WFP greatly appreciates this generous contribution from the government and people of Germany,” said WFP Tanzania Country Representative, Michael Dunford. “Germany is a key supporter of WFP in providing life-saving food assistance for refugees in Tanzania.” WFP distributes monthly rations consisting of cereal, pulses, vegetable oil and salt as well as fortified supplementary foods for vulnerable pregnant and lactating women, children under five, malnourished persons with HIV/ Aids and hospital in-patients. In addition, high energy biscuits are provided to refugees in transit. Tanzania hosts 290,000 refugees, most of them women and children, in Nduta, Nyarugusu and Mtendeli refugee camps in Kigoma Region. More than 70 per cent are from Burundi, and others are from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). “My country is proud of supporting WFP in helping those in need, who have found refuge in Tanzania,” said Dr Detlef Waechter, German Ambassador to Tanzania, adding: “It will be important to get political conditions right for the refugees to return to their home countries voluntarily and safely.” While limited funding forced reductions in rations between February 2017 and October this year, increased support from donors, including Germany, has enabled the restoration of full rations. However, WFP said it would continue raising funds so that food rations did not need to be reduced in coming months.
