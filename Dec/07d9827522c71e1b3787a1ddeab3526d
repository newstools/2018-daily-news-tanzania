BISHOP Augustine Ndeliakyama Shao of the Diocese of Zanzibar has called on Tanzanians to praise and acknowledge the efforts being undertaken by the fifth phase of government under the stewardship of President John Magufuli, to transform the nation. “We should salute the current government. Many impressive achievements have been registered under President Magufuli’s leadership, one of which is increasing accountability in security forces,” Bishop Shao said in his Christmas message to Roman Catholic worshippers. He said the performance of President Ali Mohamed Shein’s government was also impressive. The cleric urged Tanzanians to support both leaders by working hard, being accountable, paying taxes, and be ready to give evidence in court against perpetrators of sexual abuse. He pointed out that it was crucial to address the violation of people’s rights, especially those of poor people; otherwise, proclaiming that ‘God is with us’ would be rendered hollow. “We must join forces to curb the abuse of children, including defilement, sodomy and rape; as well as human trafficking, racism, political and religious discrimination. These hamper our development,” Bishop Shao said. He said whereas the ongoing reforms were commendable as they had the potential for reducing poverty, responding to complaints by poor people over their problems was crucial, alongside the enforcement of laws. Bishop Shao further indicated that violation of human rights and lack of accountability compromised peace. “Abject poverty, corruption, tax evasion, theft, harassment, dishonesty within marriages and other vices are disgraceful and must be tackled earnestly,” he told the congregation. The cleric also urged Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) staff to be ethical in discharging their obligations.
