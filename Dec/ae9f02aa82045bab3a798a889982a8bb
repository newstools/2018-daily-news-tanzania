AS the number of small and large-scale industries and buildings increases, the National Environment Management Council (NEMC) has started training on impact assessment of industries and buildings on environment. Speaking during a three-day training workshop for public and private experts, which ended in Dar es Salaam  on Wednesday, NEMC Head of Review Impact Assessment Section Ritha Minja said in the wake of industrialisation and urbanisation, there was a need to have good experts, who could assess the impact of buildings and physical infrastructure on the environment. “This is the focus of this training on our experts. Our friends at the (Indian) Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) have enormous experience and invaluable knowledge on this aspect. That is why we have asked them to share their priceless knowledge and experience with us because their contribution will help us quite a lot,” she said, explaining that NEMC and CSE had long history of fruitful cooperation. CSE Environmental Governance (Impact Assessment) Senior Programme Manager Sujit Kumar Singh said such training was part of the cooperation agreement between the council and the Indian centre. “This training seeks to build the capacity of trainees, especially on impact assessment of infrastructure on the environment,” he said. Architects and Quantity Surveyors Registration Board (AQRB) representative Thabit Khalid said training had expanded the horizon of the impact of physical infrastructure on the environment. “We are thankful to the organisers of this training because we will do our work taking into account environmentally friendly practices,” he said. He noted that architects needed such kind of training to build their capacity.
