TANZANIA has continued attracting various investors with Vivo Energy being one of the firms that has expressed interest in setting up shop in the country. The UK-based oil marketing firm is set to start operations with initial capital of $3m from March next year. Speaking in Arusha yesterday, Engen Petroleum (Tz) Managing Director Paul Muhato said Vivo Energy would set up some businesses in the country next year, thanks to Tanzania’s enabling business environment. “Vivo Energy Plc will start its operations in Tanzania next year. This is due to a favourable business environment in the country,” said Mr Muhato after launching a new Engen filling station in Tengeru, Arusha. In September this year, Vivo Energy announced that it had reached a deal to acquire Engen’s operations in eight African countries, including Tanzania. It was stated that the transfer of Engen’s business to Vivo would be completed by March 2019. This is set to expand Vivo Energy’s investments in Africa and will also see the firm increase its target market by nearly 150 million people to about 35 per cent of the African population. Currently, Vivo Energy operates in retail commercial fuels, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and lubricants in Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritius, Morocco, Namibia, Senegal, Tunisia and Uganda. Mr Muhato commended the government’s efforts through the Energy Ministry for cracking down on fuel adulteration and tax evasion. “We are happy with measures taken by the government that have intensified the crackdown on fuel adulteration and created fair competition,” he noted. The launch of the Tengeru filling station brings the number of petrol stations owned by Engen to two in the city. It is also the eighth in the country. The firm also operates in Dar es Salaam, Tanga, Morogoro and Coast Region.
