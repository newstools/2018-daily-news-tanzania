MEDICAL doctors in Nkasi District in Rukwa Region who allegedly defied a court order summoning them to testify in teenage pregnancy cases are likely to face disciplinary and legal measures. The Nkasi District Principal Magistrate, Mr Ramadhan Rugemalira, said recently that the health experts who deliberately ignored the courtâ€™s call would be arrested and arraigned for contempt of court. Some doctors have been accused of being an obstacle in curbing early marriage and pregnancies in the district. Latest statistics show that 115 teenagers have been impregnated during the last 12 months in Nkasi District. The incidents were reported to police stations and suspected men were arrested but majority escaped from the legal hand due to lack of sufficient evidence, including medical tests. Mr Rugemalira warned that the court will now start issuing arrest warrants to all defiant medical doctors who refuse to cooperate as required. He was speaking during a stakeholders meeting, which was coordinated by the Non Governmental Organisation (NGO) Plan International that implements project on fighting early marriage and teenage pregnancies in ten wards in Nkasi District. The stakeholders from Nkandasi, Mkwamba and Mtenda wards have met to evaluate the implementation of the project for 2018 and prepare project strategy for 2019. Nkasi District Commissioner Said Mtanda said people should not rest until the problems of early marriages and pregnancies are permanently addressed.
