PRESIDENT Ali Mohamed Shein has welcomed Dubai based company Al Nakhil to invest in Zanzibar in the tourism sector because opportunities for investment are still many. In a meeting with the company chairperson, Sheikh Ali Rashid Lootah at the State House, Dr Shein said his government will provide all the necessary support to Al Nakhil Company to establish investment projects in the tourism industry. “We have improved the environment for investments, which includes better infrastructure along with attracting more tourists,” said Dr Shein, arguing that having direct flights between Zanzibar and Dubai is important in increasing the number of tourists. He said many flights have schedules to Zanzibar; therefore it is high time the Emirates company should also start direct flights to Zanzibar, a growing tourist destination for many tourists across the globe. During the meeting, the president also commended the Al Nakhil company chairperson for supporting construction or renovation of different mosques in the Islands dominated by Muslim followers. Dr Shein who once visited “Palm Jumairah” project in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), praised the development in the Middle East Arab countries, saying Zanzibar has a lot to learn or copy from them. Sheikh Ali Rashid Lootah commended Dr Shein for the admirable achievements in development programmes, promising to act as an ambassador to promote Zanzibar abroad along with talking with the Emirates airline administration to decide whether it is possible to start direct flights to Zanzibar. “Improving infrastructure, water supply and security are essential in attracting investors and tourists. Thank you for the efforts in having a favourable environment for investments,” he said.
