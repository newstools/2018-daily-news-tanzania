Thousands of commuters have been forced to walk to work in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, as a ban on public minibuses from accessing the city centre takes effect. Last week, city authorities announced that the minibuses - known as matatus - will have to pick and drop off passengers at a terminal outside the cityâ€™s Central Business District. City hall says the directive is an attempt to decongest the capital where more than 20,000 matatus operate. But critics claim the terminus where matatus are forced to stop are not big enough to handle the high number of minibuses.
