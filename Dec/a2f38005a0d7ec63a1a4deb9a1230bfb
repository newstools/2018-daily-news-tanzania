PREPARATIONS for the launch of ‘The Future I Want Summit and Awards’ (FISA) to be held on December 22nd at the Dar es Salaam University College of Education in the city are on top gear. The event has specifically been organised to award the rising talented youths in different categories of their choice who are doing commendable works in their communities as one way to motivate and plant seeds of self confidence in them which is a key to reach their dreams. “The main aim of this project is to bring back hope to the youth mainly those living in the streets that all is not lost for them since they can easily recover from whatever bad things they are going through and become productive citizens of the country,” said Jacob Tito, Programme Manager of Lambokile Company which has organised the event. He further said the project also targets school going students by reminding them to always have positive mentality throughout their studying period in order to make their dreams come true. “We have created various categories for unpopular youths in the country to compete each other whereby people have been given the chance to vote for anybody who they think is eligible to win in that category such that winners would be awarded with different prizes on the launching day,” Tito disclosed. He added that FISA is destined to promote unknown talented young people and put them on the international map. The six categories being contested for by the rising youths include The Best Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Performer of the Year whose nominees are Evodius Gervas, Einoth Ngotoroi, Mfaume Msasa and Samwel Maphie. Similarly, four nominees who are Frank Mbwana, Kabula Lukago, Jane Mgaya and Hamad Mtamani are fighting hard to excel in the category of The Best Youngest Entrepreneur of the Year. Another fierce battle is in the category of The Best Young Innovator of the Year being contested by Hellena Sailas, Q ueen Johnbosco, Noel Mapunda and Suzan Yumbe while The Best Youngest Influential of the Year segment has attracted Jacob Mushi, Kalegeya Zahoro and Maziku Kuwandu.
