THE World Business Angels Investment Forum (WBAIF) chairperson, Baybars Altuntas, says the outfit was planning to open a branch here, to help young people secure jobs. He made the pledge during a meeting with the Second Vice President Ambassador Seif Ali Iddi here. He said the branch would be opened by February next year with the objective of supporting youth become innovative. “We plan to support youth in developing their skills and innovations. This will divert them from engaging in criminal activities due to idleness,” Mr Altuntas said. According to a press statement, Mr Iddi said unemployment was one of the major challenges facing Zanzibar, and that, therefore, plans to support the youth were highly welcomed. The Principal Secretary, Mr Khamis Mussa, said the WBAIF centre in Zanzibar would be useful to both the youth and government. WBAIF is an international organisation with objectives to ease access to finance for business from start-up to scale up with the goal of generating more jobs and more social justice worldwide. The PS said the focus would be on empowering the youth, who constitute the largest group of the Tanzanian population, with innovative and entrepreneurial skills. “The youth should grab the opportunities and make the best use of them,” he said.
