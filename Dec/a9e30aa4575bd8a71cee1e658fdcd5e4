CONSTRUCTION of Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO) headquarters building at Ihumwa area in Dodoma City, is slated to get underway next financial year, Managing Director (MD) of TANESCO, Dr Tito Mwinuka, has revealed. Dr Mwinuka, while speaking to reporters shortly after reporting to his new office here Tuesday, said plans for the project to construct the new headquarters on a 1.15 hectare of land on the outskirts of the city were ongoing. “We expect to commence construction works for our permanent headquarters in the upcoming financial year. Presently, TANESCO will use the building which used to house the company’s regional office,” said the TANESCO Managing Director. Dr Mwinuka said the first batch of 30 workers had already moved to Dodoma from Dar es Salaam after TANESCO relocated its headquarters to the Capital City, saying the company started operating from its new headquarters located at Jamatini Street in Dodoma City on Monday. He said moving to Dodoma will help to facilitate its operations largely in taking part of building the capital city, saying the move will not affect its operations elsewhere due to having offices across the country. “We’re happy to be part of the team in building Dodoma City. Relocating to Dodoma will facilitate our fully participation in building the Capital City,” he said. Last week, TANESCO said in a statement that moving to Dodoma will not affect its operations and provision of services to its customers, and that services are available close to all their customers. “Having regional and district offices across the country, TANESCO wishes to inform the general public that the move will not affect its operations elsewhere,” read part of the statement which was issued by the Communications Unit of TANESCO.
