PREVENTION and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) in Mwanza Region has saved a total of 10.3m/- that was on the verge of being embezzled by some dishonest government officials. Speaking to reporters here over the weekend, the PCCB Acting Mwanza Regional boss, Mr Emmanuel Stenga said the money was saved by their hawkeyed officials in July, this year. “Part of the cash was allocated for payments to contractors, who were constructing various development projects, but fortunately enough, our investigation team revealed that there was a plan to pay it to ghost workers,” he pointed out. He said the money was saved from all Mwanza Regional Councils, and at the same his institution registered four new cases in the Court, besides seeing about 800 reports/complaints being lodges by some citizens for being not given adequate services by some local leaders and Councils’ staff in their areas of work. However, Mr Stenga hinted that about 19 development projects worth 7.1bn/-, were implemented in the region, and his team was monitoring them, although one raised eyebrows. “One project of over 69m/- seemed to be defective and investigative measures against it are still under way,” he added. “In ensuring that the fight against corruption was achieved, we are setting strategies that would ensure that all wananchi report doubted issues to the authority,” he advised
