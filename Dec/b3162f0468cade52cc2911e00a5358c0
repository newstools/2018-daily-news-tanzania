SIHA District Commissioner (DC), Onesmo Buswelo has unveiled plans to engage all district commissioners in the country in promoting domestic tourism by climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in order to boost tourism earnings. Mr Buswelo was representing the Kilimanjaro Regional Commissioner (RC) Anna Mghwira in receiving a group of 52 people from different institutions who climbed Mount Kilimanjaro to mark 57 independence anniversaries. “I will encourage all district commissioners countrywide to use their recreation time to climb the Africa’s highest pick of Kilimanjaro in order to promote domestic tourism and government revenue from the sector,” he said. He said the initiative targeting all district commissioners will be one of the strategies in influencing the public to climb Mount Kilimanjaro and visit other tourism attractions in the country. “Foreign visitors travel thousands of kilometers to witness the wonders of Mount Kilimanjaro but most of Tanzanians are not taking any initiatives to visit the country’s tourism attractions,” he said. He said the Kilimanjaro regional authority is collaborating with Tanzania National Parks (TANAPA) to ensure conservation of Kilimanjaro Mountain and its surroundings is achieved. On his part, the retired General, George Waitara commended the patriotism of the group of 52 people who managed to climb Mount Kilimanjaro to mark the independence anniversaries. General (rtd) Waitara has been climbing Mount Kilimanjaro every year since 2008.
