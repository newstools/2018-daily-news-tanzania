BUSINESS community members and farmers engaged in selling meat and chicken have been told that they are free to construct a slaughter house for livestock and poultry but should adhere to regulations, including cleanliness. “We need clean slaughter houses with proper disposal facilities. The food should be of high hygienic standards,” Second Vice-President Ambassador Seif Ali Iddi said here during an impromptu visit to slaughter houses. He saw firsthand, how filthy the slaughter houses were, prompting him to issue orders, particularly to owners of slaughter centres, to ensure that the slaughter and processing of meat were conducted in a clean environment. Ambassador Iddi visited the government owned animal slaughter houses in Kisakasaka and Donge villages, as well as private ones in Kisakasaka and Aneani- Donge. He urged authorities to ensure that slaughter houses operated in clean environments. His directives have been made against the backdrop of several complaints against filthy slaughter houses in Zanzibar. Theft of livestock, especially cattle and goats, has also been cited as a major problem, partly attributed to lack of a system of conclusively establishing whether those selling the animals were legitimate owners. V illagers have been complaining bitterly over an alarming rate of thefts of their animals. “The animals are stolen at night and slaughtered secretly.” Ms Hawa Said Kassim, an officer in charge of livestock in Unguja West B municipality, said the Kisakasaka slaughterhouse was under renovation, following which it would become a modern facility.
