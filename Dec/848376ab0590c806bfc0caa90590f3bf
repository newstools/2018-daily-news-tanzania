He stressed the need to identify the economic opportunities and tap them fully as they strive and guided by the codes of conduct and guidelines of fair competition. The meeting that brought together traders from the TCCIA, CTI, SIDO and other business members among others wanted to discuss and deal with challenges, taking into consideration the Dodoma status of designated Capital and City.
