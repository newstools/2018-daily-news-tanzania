CHIEF Justice (CJ), Prof Ibrahim Juma, says it is high time Lushoto-based Institute of Judicial Administration (IJA) started conducting research and giving advice to address a conflict of laws. Speaking yesterday, the CJ said as the judiciary was mandated to dispense justice in the country, IJA should help the judiciary address the conflict of laws. Prof Juma was launching the third IJA workers’ council meeting, which brought together representatives from all units in the public institute to discuss an annual IJA performance report. He said IJA should ensure the IJA strategic plan to address challenges facing the institute, such as a shortage of working tools and personnel in administration. Prof Juma reminded the IJA staff to stick to integrity in discharging their duties, noting that they were also responsible to help the government attain its industrial economy agenda. He urged the IJA staff to shun corruption, absconding from work and any kind of bad working habits, saying all that tarnished the image of IJA, the judiciary and public service. IJA Principal Justice Paul Kihwelo said accommodation remained a big challenge facing IJA, saying the construction of a hostel for male students had stalled for the fourth year. Justice Kihwelo, who doubles as chairman of the IJA workers’ council, appealed to the judiciary to help the IJA to complete hostel construction to address the accommodation challenge. He noted that IJA recently launched a five-year strategic plan commencing 2018-2023, which was geared towards uplifting the IJA to international level, saying the programme would help address a few challenges facing the facility. Lushoto-based IJA is well recognised internationally for designing, preparing and organising judiciary training for judges, magistrates, state attorneys, police officers and warders. It also conducts a number of different legal researches and gives advice on good justice management.
