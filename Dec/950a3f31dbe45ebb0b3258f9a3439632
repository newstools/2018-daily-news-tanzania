President Meron noted that the budgetary and operational challenges the mechanism has faced over the previous six months are well-known. “Significant advances have been made in the completion of the Mechanism’s mandate… underlining the Mechanism’s continued and efforts to ensure that key residual functions are carried out with steadfast professionalism,” he pointed out. A communiqué made available to the ‘Daily News’ by the Mechanism’s branch in Arusha, said that President Meron paid a special tribute to the Registrar of the Mechanism, Mr Olufemi Elias (a Nigerian lawyer) for his leadership, abiding integrity and excellent stewardship. President Meron emphasized the recent adoption of the Rules of Detention governing matters both in Arusha and The Hague (another branch of the Mechanism) as well as the adoption of amendments to the Rules of Procedure and Evidence as a reflection of the Mechanism’s unceasing attention to finding ways to improve its methods and work and serve as a model for courts in other jurisdictions.
