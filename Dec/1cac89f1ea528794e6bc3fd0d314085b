TANZANIA Ports Authority (TPA) has promised to provide 1bn/- to complete the construction of Kagunga Market in Kigoma District. The project will boost trade between Tanzania and Great Lakes countries to make Kagunga Harbour more effective. Speaking at the weekend at Kigoma Port, TPA Director General Deusdedit Kakoko said the construction of the market would boost revenue. He said the construction and opening of the market would increase the number of traders and vessels that would be using the harbour and in this first phase TPA had provided 300m/- to ensure the market was developed and started providing services. Mr Kakoko added that TPA had also dished out 500m/- for strengthening a road to the harbour area from the border of Burundi leading to the harbour to facilitate imports and exports through the port. For his part, Kigoma Port Manager Ajuaye Kher Msese presenting performance information to Director General said there had been a substantial increase in shipping of cargo to the DRC, Burundi and Zambia, thus increasing government revenue. Mr Msese said major improvements continuing at Kigoma Port had enabled the harbour to operate efficiently by increasing load and self-reliance without subsidies. Mr Msese added that the trend had increased income collection from 4.1bn/- in 2016/17 to 6.8bn/- in 2017/18 and the plan was to increase shipping cargo to about 500,000 tonnes through the port by 2020.
