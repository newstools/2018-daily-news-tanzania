DECCA College of Health and Allied Sciences (Decohas) Board Chairman, Dr Ezekiel Mpuya, says his facility plans to set up a pharmaceutical plant in Nala on the outskirts of Dodoma City. Speaking at Decohas’ second graduation ceremony, the construction of a new factory is expected to be completed in 2020. Dr Mpuya said Decohas was a private higher learning institution owned by Decca Company, which provides health education to Tanzanians. The idea is to transform the college into a high-tech university. “The department of pharmacy has started production of soap and skin medication, among others,’’ he said. He added that the construction of the administration block and a modern laboratory was progressing well and after the construction of the two buildings, the construction of a modern hospital, staff houses and a pharmaceutical factory would kick off immediately. For her part, the guest of honour, Dr Z ainabu Chaula, who represented Minister of State in the President’s Office (Regional Administration and Local Government) Selemani Jafo stressed the need for having competent medics if attaining the country’s development vision was anything to go by. She said the ratio of patients and doctors, according to the current human resources strategy, was one doctor to between 30,000 and 50,000 patients. “Therefore, I urge all stakeholders in this region to help this college attain its objectives of providing education to health workers,’’ she noted.
