PREPARATIONS for the glamorous Tanzania All Stars Basketball Bonanza to be held at Mao Tse - Tung Stadium in Zanzibar on January 20th next year are progressing well according to plans. This was confirmed yesterday by the founder and Director of Zanzibar Young Basketballers Association (ZYBA) Aziz Salim, who said this time around, they have decided to make the big event more colourful. “ZYBA has been in the game for the past four years and we have conducted four basketball bonanzas since then which involved selecting best players of the game from here and divide them into two competing teams,” he said. He added that for the first time, the event would attract best basketball players from Tanzania Mainland who will be selected from various regions and form their team to compete with their counterparts in Zanzibar. “We want to bring onboard our friends from Tanzania Mainland so that together, we can make the upcoming bonanza very competitive “As you already know, sports brings people together, creates fun and enables participants to share various skills vital for the health development of the sport in the country,” Salim said.
