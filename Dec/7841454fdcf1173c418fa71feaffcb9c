THE Institute of Physics (IOP) has yesterday launched a programme to encourage students at secondary school level in the country to be entrepreneurs in the market of science and technology business. The two-day programme of Future STEM Business Leaders, which is hosted by Dar Teknohama Business Incubator (DTBi) aiming at encouraging students at the secondary level in the country to use business ideas to solve local challenges through science and technology. Speaking on the programme, DTBi Chief Executive Officer, Dr George Mulamula said the programme provides a unique opportunity for students to learn about the relationship between science and business and gain first-hand experience about how science based businesses operate in Tanzania. “We are doing this to help students develop these skills by taking them through the process from identifying a science-based solution to a problem in the local community, to preparing the business idea for market,” he said. According to him, by doing this at the school level ensures that students are better prepared to be innovative and entrepreneurial at university, which in turn makes it easier for students to develop innovative and sustainable solutions to solve community problems. On her part, the President of IOP, Prof Dame Julia Higgins, added that by supporting the Tanzanian science, technology and business communities, including the Tanzanian Physical Society, they are joining forces to tackle a national challenge –those science students in Tanzania finish school with very little in the way of business skills. “But Tanzania’s economy relies on a growing science and technology private sector. By working together with the University of Dar es Salaam, DTBi, schools and business leaders from across Tanzania–we are together achieving incredible results to help equip young people in Tanzania for a strong future,” she said.
