THE number of elephants has increased by 2,000 at Selous Game Reserve (SGR) in one year, thanks to routine patrols carried out by well-trained wildlife rangers against poachers and subsequently reducing poaching incidences. Latest statistics show that the number of elephants in SGR has spiralled from 13,000 in 2013 to 15,000 in 2014, according to the census carried out by Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (Tawiri). Tanzania Wildlife Authority (Tawa) Communication and Relations Officer Twaha Twalibu told the ‘Daily News’ during a telephone interview that poaching had been controlled in the area. Mr Twalibu further noted that poaching at SGR had decreased and the number of elephant carcass had dropped from 131 in 2012 to only five in 2018. He further noted that such routine patrols were carried out by wildlife rangers from Tawa jointly with those from Tanzania National Parks (Tanapa), Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority (NCAA), Tanzania Forest Service (TFS) as well as state organs and several international and local conservation institutes, including World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Mr Twalibu noted that the number of elephants at SGR were 109,000 in 1977 and then decreased to 55,000 and it drastically drooped to 31,000 in 1989. Similarly, the number of elephants at SGR continued decreasing to only 22,000 in 1991. “But after mounting special operations to contain poaching at SGR, the number of elephants shot up from 22,000 to 52,000 and by 2007, it reached 70,000. Unfortunately, poaching increased largely and subsequently the number of elephants dropped sharply to 13,000.” “We started mounting special operations to remove cattle from game and forest reserves. We also sealed loopholes for illegal entry and arrested poachers, thanks to drones, rangers and intelligence skills,” he said. “As a result, the number of elephants shot up from 13,000 in 2013 to 15,000 in 2014,” he added. He said the number of elephants had increased considerably as they had started invading fields and some were even seen roaming around the precincts of the University of Dodoma (Udom).
