ZANZIBAR Football Association (ZFA) has rescheduled the Isles Premier League fixture, pushing the matches which were to be staged yesterday to January, 2019. Among the teams affected by the fixture change are JKU and Z imamoto, who were to play at Gombani Stadium in Pemba. An official from ZFA, Mohammed Ali Hilali said the teams couldn’t play at Gombani Stadium in Pemba because the venue has been closed for rehabilitation. “The stadium is being renovated for Zanzibar Revolution Day on January 12,” he explained. He said the teams refused to play their matches at Finya ground saying it doesn’t meet standards. Until this week Z anzibar league has been dominated by teams from Unguja as the going has been very thorny to Pemba-based teams. With Unguja-based teams command the league’s top posts, their Pemba opponents have been forced to crawl at the bottom of the league’s table. The latest victims are Chipukizi, Jamhuri and Hard Rock, all suffered heavy losses in Wednesday. Chipukizi lost 3-1 to Malindi of Unguja in a match held at Kiwengwa grounds. The next match of the day saw Chuoni punishing Jamhuri with 2-0 at the Amaan Stadium in Z anzibar. The third victims, Hard Rock fought hard despite losing to Mlandege in their afternoon match held earlier at Amaan Stadium. Chuo who have notched 27 points after the win, scored their goals through Abdilahi Rajab in the 3rd minute and Hamad Mshamata who added the second in the 62nd minute. Isles football giants, KMKM and Polisi made sky- high leaps in their campaign for league title after posting hefty victories in their Tuesday encounters.
