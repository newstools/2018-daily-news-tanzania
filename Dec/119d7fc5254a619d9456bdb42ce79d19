AT least 5,500 poor households in Tarime District have received over 200m/- from Tanzania Action Social Fund (Tasaf), Tasaf District Coordinator Emmanuel Kadama has said. The money was successfully paid to targeted households in both Tarime District Council and Tarime Town Council in November and December, this year, according to Mr Kadama. “We have paid all 5,525 households in this phase of November-December and 200,200,000/- has reached the targeted beneficiaries,” Mr Kadama said on Friday during a media briefing on the performance of the programme in the area. He said the latest beneficiary households were from 44 rural villages in Tarime District Council and 22 streets of Tarime Town council. Tasaf is a national initiative that helps to transform the lives of poor households across the country. Mr Kadama said the number of poor families that needed to be registered with Tasaf was big in the area. “Many citizens want to be enrolled with Tasaf after seeing the benefits of the programme and this is one of the challenges we are now facing,” he said.
