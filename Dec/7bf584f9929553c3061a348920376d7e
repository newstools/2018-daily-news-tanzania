POLICE in Dar es Salaam has banned all acts that may lead to breach of peace during this festival season and warned city dwellers to observe the country’s rules and regulations as they celebrate Christmas and New Year. Dar es Salaam’s Special Zone Police Commander, Lazaro Mambosasa said that the force has banned activities such as disco for young children commonly known as ‘Disco Toto’ and fireworks except with special permission. He said that the permission for fireworks may be sought from and granted only by the Inspector General of Police (IGP) under special request. “Police in Dar es Salaam special zone in collaboration with other security organs is firm in maintaining peace during Christmas and New Year celebrations, patrols will be strengthened around houses of worship, beaches and populated areas,” Commander Mambosasa told members of the press in Dar es Salaam yesterday. The special zone commander went on and counselled parents to make sure that children are accompanied by adults in their movements while owners of entertainment spots to abide by rules and laws by making sure that they don’t organise disco or allow congestion of people in their clubs which may threaten their lives. On motorists, the commander cautioned on adherence to guiding laws by avoiding overloading, speeding and unnecessary noise that may bring about avoidable atrocities. “We don’t expect ‘disko toto’ in Dar es Salaam because we haven’t received any request for that, let people celebrate with their families,” he insisted. He added that some traditional dances popularly known as ‘Vigodoro’ are against Tanzanian culture because people who perform them dress indecently and demoralise children who are the future generation of the nation. The special zone commander warned commercial motorbike riders alias bodaboda to also abide by rules and respect road signs and not to overload their bikes and that they should have valid driving licences.
