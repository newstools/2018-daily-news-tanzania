A man has opened gunfire near the city of Strasbourg's famous Christmas market Tuesday night, killing three people, wounding 12. Hundreds of police officers are hunting the gunman who is known to security services, escaped after exchanging fire with soldiers and armed police. It is believed that the attacker is injured. French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner explained that the motive for the incident remains unclear adding that "He fought twice with our security forces.” He said the border controls had been strengthened and security at all Christmas markets would be stepped up, with 350 security agents hunting for the gunman.
