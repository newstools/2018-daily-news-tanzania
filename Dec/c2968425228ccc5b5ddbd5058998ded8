Vodacom Tanzania and Tecno have partnered to introduce new mobile handset into the market as part of the contribution in promoting and creating digital society. The initiative comes at the time when internet penetration in the country has reached over 22 million, which is 45 per cent compared to more than 19 million users in the previous year, the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) report shows. Tecno Communication Manager Mr Eric Mkomoya said in Dar es Salaam on Wednesday that their partnership with Vodacom in launching Tecno Camon 11 is important in transforming the society into using smartphone. “We are committed to ensure all Tanzanians own smartphone that can enable them access necessary information in their social and economic activities,” he said. Vodacom Tanzania Head of Communication and Public Relations at Vodacom Jacquiline Materu said the initiative aims at giving Vodacom customers opportunity to own new smartphone for access to information that supports their economic activities like agriculture and business.
