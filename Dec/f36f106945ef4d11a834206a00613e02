SHINYANGA based Stand United Coach, Athuman Bilal has conceded that the going is tough for his team in the ongoing Mainland Premier League. Speaking after their 1-1 draw against Kagera Sugar at the CCM Kambarage Stadium on Friday, Bilal said the league is tough because each team is fighting to get good results. The host goal was netted by Datius Peter in the 18th minutes, while the former Mwadui FC, Young Africans and Majimaji striker Jerryson Tegete equalised for Kagera Sugar in the 35th minute. Despite the draw, Bilal said his team played well regardless of making mistakes that denied them the victory. He promised to rectify the mistakes before their next match on Saturday. Bilal said they are still building their team after losing several key players in his first team. “We played well today (Friday) in order to win but our opponents capitalised on the mistakes made by defenders to snatch an equaliser,” he said. He called on the Shinyanga region football fraternity to continue supporting their team in the remaining league matches and in the Azam Sports Federation Cup (ASFC) matches. For his part, Kagera Sugar Head Coach, Mecky Mexime congratulated his players for the draw. Commenting about his team’s performance, Mexime said his players did a good job to earn a draw against Stand United at their own backyard. He said his team played well, especially in the first half but in the second half they slowed down a bit. Stand United are now placed 13th on the log after collecting 18 points. They have lost nine, drawn three and won five matches. Kagera Sugar are placed seventh with 21 points
