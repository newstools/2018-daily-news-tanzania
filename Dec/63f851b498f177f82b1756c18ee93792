THE Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) has helped the government to recover 70.334bn/- following operations mounted between July 2017 and June 2018. Speaking during the opening of the PCCB annual general meeting yesterday, PCCB Director General Iwani Athumani said the money recovered had increased compared to what was recovered in 2016/17. “PCCB has investigated 906 cases of embezzlement of public funds, corruption, abuse of public office, tax evasion and 495 of them were filed in court,” said the PCCB boss. Mr Athumani noted that during that period, PCCB monitored the implementation of development projects countrywide to ensure value for money, so 661 projects, including eight mega public projects worth 45bn/-, were monitored. “Legal action has been taken against those implicated in corruption and the embezzlement of public funds,” he said. Mr Athumani explained further that PCCB had embarked on a programme to raise awareness on corruption targeting different groups, especially the youth, as some young people had believed that “if there is no bribe, there is no service”. Opening the meeting, Minister of State in the President’s Office (Public Service Management and Good Governance) George Mkuchika directed PCCB to prevent corruption incidents in upcoming local government elections next year. He noted that PCCB should start developing strategies to curb corruption in the elections. “Prevention of corruption in elections is vital to get leaders, who are elected lawfully,” said the minister. Mr Mkuchika commended PCCB after many cases ruled in their favour in court in 2017/18, pointing out that 178 of 296 cases filed by PCCB, were ruled in favour of PCCB for that period (equivalent to 60.6 per cent). “PCCB has registered great strides in such cases for the past year, facilitating a recovery of over 70bn/-. The money was reallocated for the purchase of medicine in hospitals,” he said.
