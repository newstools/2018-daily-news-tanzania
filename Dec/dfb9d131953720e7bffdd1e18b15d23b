TANZANIA has embarked on a serious succession plan that will see more locals taking over senior posts left by foreign experts in the three giant gold mines. Dubbed Rainbow Leadership Development Programme, the arrangement seeks to see more local experts assuming the leadership posts in North Mara, Bulyanhulu and Buzwagi Gold Mines with more than 295 of them graduated in the last two years. Revealing more on the programme to reporters over the weekend, Acacia’s General Manager for Organisational Effectiveness Janet Reuben- Lekashingo said the Rainbow Leadership Development Programme forms the company’s long term strategy aiming to see Tanzanian assets being led and operated by local experts. “Rainbow and other professional training programmes delivered by Acacia provide a crucial platform for our Tanzania’s economic development and industrialisation agenda and illustrates our commitment to develop human capital underscored in the Second Five Year Development Plan,” she said. Rainbow Programme, which initially began in 2016 saw a total of 93 Acacia staff members graduating in different leadership perspectives and decorated in a ceremony that took place here at the weekend. According to Ms Leuben- Lekashingo, the programme comes at a time when the company is progressing plans to transition key business functions in support of its Tanzanian operations such as supply chain, sales and payroll.
