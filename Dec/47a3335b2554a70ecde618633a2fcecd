FOUR schools in Arumeru District got a major boost yesterday after the NMB Bank gave them iron sheets and other learning equipment worth 20m/-. The schools that will benefit from the NMB’s support include Ngaramtoni Primary School, Mwandeti, Mukulat and Kimnyak Secondary Schools. Both, Ngaramtoni Primary and Mwandeti Secondary school received 166 corrugated iron sheets while Kimnyak Secondary got 162 iron sheets. The bank also donated 166 laboratory stools to Mukulat Secondary School. Speaking during the handover ceremony, Arumeru District Commissioner Jerry Muro said his district was faced with serious shortage of classrooms to occupy form one students next academic year. “We are expecting 107 form ones next year but we don’t have enough classrooms to accommodate them,” he said. Mr Muro revealed that his office was struggling to raise 2.5bn/- for construction of classrooms, urging well-wishers and other financial institutions to step in. “My humble request to other institutions to at least help us with the construction of 15 classrooms,” he appealed. He commended NMB for the donation, calling on other financial institutions to follow suit. NMB’s acting Northern Zone Manager, Cosmas Sadat said the bank had a noble responsibility of complementing the government’s efforts of providing quality education to Tanzanians. He added that the Bank was currently focusing on improving the education sector and other social services. “NMB has this year allocated 1bn/- for social services, the highest contribution than any other financial institution in the country,” he explained. Mr Sadat said he was optimistic that the support to the four schools in Arumeru District will be reflected on the academic performance of the students at the schools. Boasting of three million customers countrywide, NMB has a network of more than 212 branches, more than 800 ATM Machines and 4,100 banking agents.
