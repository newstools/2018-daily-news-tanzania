THE government has welcomed recommendations to develop competence-based curriculum, which emphasises outcomes of a learning process for primary and secondary education levels. Deputy Minister in the President’s Office (Regional Administration and Local Government) Josephat Kandege told a recent conference on quality education that the government was ready to receive recommendations from key education stakeholders to improve the curriculum. “Review of the curriculum will be conducted to impart to graduates employable skills,” said the deputy minister, while opening the 10th annual quality education conference (QEC). Under the theme ‘Collective Accountability and Quality Education for Self- Reliance, the conference jointly organised by Tanzania Education Network (TenMet) and Right To Play, brought together key education stakeholders to discuss the quality of education. Mr Kandege told the meeting that the government would work on deliberations reached in the meeting, noting that the aim of the review was to enable fresh graduates to cope with current changes. “Half of graduates in East Africa lack employable skills and this situation poses a big challenge to job seekers,” noted the deputy minister.
