The Council’s Executive Secretary, Ms Beng’i Issa said this during the Mwanamke Sahihi Exclusive Event 2018 organised by Purple Planet Tanzania in Dar es Salaam over the weekend that attracted over 1,000 women from different parts of the country. “Women make enormous contributions to economies through businesses, farming, entrepreneurship or employment, or by doing unpaid care work at home,” she said. While commending Purple Planet Tanzania for the initiative that has helped women to grow their businesses and other careers. Ms Issa said the government recognizes various efforts by stakeholders in promoting and supporting women empowerment to enhance their contributions in the economy and improved livelihoods. Women entrepreneurs are increasingly recognized for the success of their businesses and for the important contributions to the country’s economic well-being. “Women’s economic empowerment is positively correlated with improved family welfare and nutrition, higher education levels for girls and improved economic growth for society as a whole,” she added. One of the winners of the Mwanamke Sahihi Exclusive Event 2018, Ms Anna Njavike said having courage and confidence in everything they do is key to women successful. “Cultivating courage and confidence can help women unlock immense opportunities through negotiating deals, closing sales, pitching investors for growth capital,” she said.
