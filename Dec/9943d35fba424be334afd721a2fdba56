Tanzanian Business Community (JWT) has postponed a meeting aimed at making a statement to support President John Magufuli's statement on tax collection procedures in the country. Postponing the open session at Mnazi Mmoja grounds in Dar es Salaam on Thursday morning, JWK chairman Silver Kiondo said that the main factor for adjournment was security concerns. "Security officials have advised us to push forward this session due to the existence of many activities in the city and thus it is difficult to take care of security issues concurrently, " he said. He said the session will take place tomorrow and will announce their support of President Magufuli's statement and air their views and complaints related to tax paying. "Our goal is not to bring aggression but to present our statement with the good intention of improving our performance in our conducts," said the chairman in front of the business community members in the city.
