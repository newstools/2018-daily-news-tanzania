THE Deputy Minister for Industry, Trade and Investment, Eng Stella Manyanya has stressed a need to utilise business opportunities through information and communication technology (ICT) available for improved economy. Speaking during a Fair Competition Commission (FCC) event held at the University of Dodoma (Udom) recently, she stressed increased use of business platforms that were online. The deputy minister said there were a number of business opportunities available through online platforms, so she used the occasion to urge local entrepreneurs and traders to utilise the market effectively. “We must see how best we can maximise online marketing and business platforms since it is an opportunity that has not been well-exploited by local business communities,” she said. Moreover, he urged Udom graduates to see how best they could come up with apps that would stimulate the growth of online business. “We need to create an equal business competition online and this can only be attained if we utilise well the platforms for public rather than personal economic interests,” said the deputy minister. She noted that the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) and the FCC should see how best they could harmonise online transaction costs, which were detrimental to end users. For his part, FCC board chairman, Prof Humphrey Mosha, called for a fair competition to widen business and services opportunities. He said with technological advancement, it was clear that if well-used and with timely and proper research business and planning issues, there was a clear path for business growth to the highest level in the country. FCC Director General, Dr John Mduma, stressed a need for the College of Business to ensure they were aware of all information as far as fair competition was concerned for informed decision-making.
