THREE teenagers among them a girl, residents of Mkamba Village along Rukwa Basin in Sumbawanga District, have drowned in attempt to cross a flooded river. The trio was riding on a single motorbike in ‘mishkaki’ style, returning to their respective homes in the village after attending a wedding party. The accident occurred shortly before the Christmas Eve. Rukwa Regional Police Commander (RPC) George Kyando told the ‘Daily News’ over the phone yesterday afternoon that the incident occurred at around 11:00pm on Tuesday. The RPC confirmed that the deceased were riding on the motorbike on their way back home from the wedding party. He said the deceased have been identified as Sai Pude, the girl and Mkwiba Mzanziwa (19) who was riding the motorbike and 11-year old Limi Likuwizya. The RPC said on the material night, the trio after arriving at the flooded Masili River, they attempted to crossover while riding on the motor bike. The river was flooded following the heavy rains that had pounded over the ranges of Lyamba Lya Mfipa Mountains. “The innocent teenagers attempted to cross over the flooded river and suddenly all of them with their motorbike were swept away by the strong currents and their bodies were retrieved today (yesterday) about two kilometers away,” he said. The RPC cautioned residents in the region particularly those living along Lake Rukwa basin to be extra cautious as they cross over flooded rivers particularly at this rainy season.
