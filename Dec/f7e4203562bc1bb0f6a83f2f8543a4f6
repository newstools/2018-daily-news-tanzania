MINISTER for Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development, Mr William Lukuvi will on behalf of President John Magufuli grace the New Y ear mass penciled for Karume Grounds in Ilala Municipality on 31 December. The Tanzania Fellowship of Churches (TFC) Bishop, Dr Emanuel Godfrey, disclosed in Dar es Salaam on Monday that the Minister has already confirmed his attendance. Bishop Godfrey called upon Tanzanians from all walks of life to attend the mass intended to pray for the nation. He said that the theme for the mass is, “Nchi Moja Sauti Moja” with the aim to pray for peace, unity, tranquility among other development issues. “People ought to know that praying for peace is crucial… for peace is a vital factor in the development of a country, if lost, the pace is also going to be slowed,” said Bishop Godfrey. He went on to note that for a longtime now, Tanzania has been a peaceful country, filled with love and unity among citizens; these are clear outcomes of similar prayers held from time to time,” he noted. The Bishop applauded the move by the President in overseeing that the country’s resources are in good order and making sure that people understand that they have responsibility to protect them. He further pointed out that the government has to a larger extent managed to fight corruption in the country and it is an outcome of the continuous prayers aimed for the nation. “President Magufuli has succeeded in altering the mindsets of people, who perceive themselves as marginalised to well-off people living in a country with a lot of resources,” he said. Bishop Godfrey assured the people of their security at the grounds, noting that the police will be deployed in and around the area for the particular purpose.
