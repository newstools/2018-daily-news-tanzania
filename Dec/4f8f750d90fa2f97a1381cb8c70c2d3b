On emergency civil works , Eng Msuka said that during the past 2017/18 fiscal year, the region spent 911,657,000,000/- to repair and maintain damaged roads, some as a result of floods from heavy rains, including the Ntendo – Muze road (37.04 kms) and section of Kasansa – Kilyamatundu road ( 37.04 kms). “Section of the road that links Ntendo to Muze villages were badly destroyed due to land slide, while a section of Kasansa – Kilyamatundu road due to geographical condition was washed by flood that occasionally occurs,” he added.
