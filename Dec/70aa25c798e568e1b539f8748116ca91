THE Acting Kagera Regional Administrative Secretary (RAS) Mr Onesfor Bwana is confident that 14,000 students who are on waiting list will be in classes come February, 2019. Mr Bwana told the ‘Daily News on Saturday’ that concerted efforts were being taken to sensitise each district to ensure that they complete construction of enough classrooms. "Each district has been committed to ensure that construction of classrooms is completed soon to enable the selected students to be in classes by February, next year. The region has also sent a request to the government to register four new secondary schools. This will increase the number of classes to accommodate the selected students," he said. Kagera Regional Education Development Officer (REO) Mr Aloyce Kamamba said out of the 14,046 students on the waiting list, 6,257 were boys while 7,789 were girls. He noted that about 47,228 pupils attempted the National Standard Seven Examinations which started on September 4-5, this year. Over 130,000 candidates from 17 regions who passed this year's Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) will have to wait a little longer before beginning secondary education in public schools next year due to a shortage of classrooms. This is 10 times more than the 11,173 candidates who were reportedly hit by the same problem when the 2018 calendar year began. This time around, Arusha leads among regions with 18,719 candidates who missed out on the first selection for next year, followed by Mara (16,365) and Kagera (14,046). Other regions are Simiyu (12,684), Kigoma (12,178), Tabora (11,209), Mbeya (6,395), Shinyanga (6,271), Dodoma (5,991), Tanga (5,400), Manyara (5,392), Rukwa (4,930), Coast (4,731), Njombe (3,172), Iringa (2,774), Lindi (1,294), and Katavi (1, 249). Addressing reporters in Dar es Salaam yesterday, the Minister of State in the President's Office (Regional Administration and Local Government) Mr Selemani Jafo, said all these candidates will have to wait for the second form one selection next year. According to Jafo, a total of 733,103 candidates passed this year's primary school leaving exams, of whom 599,103 (81.76 per cent) have won first selection enrolment to secondary education in public schools in January 2019. "The 18.24 per cent who missed out (133,747 candidates) will be considered for the second selection. Most of the public schools in upcountry regions are experiencing a shortage of classrooms, although some schools have managed to enrol all the qualified candidates allocated to them," the minister said. He named regions that have managed to enrol their full allocations at a go as Dar es Salaam, Geita, Kilimanjaro, Mtwara, Morogoro, Mwanza, Ruvuma, Singida and Songwe. According to Jafo, classroom construction projects are currently in progress in most of the needy public schools, with regional and district authorities directed to fast-track their completion so that all remaining qualified candidates are enrolled before the end of February next year. He called on parents whose children have missed out on the first selection despite passing their exams to be patient, adding: "My emphasis to parents, guardians, teachers and authorities is to ensure that all these children remain motivated to stay in school and study hard." Meanwhile, Mr Leonard Kantali (46), a businessman in Bukoba municipality is being interrogated by police in connection with an incident where a standard seven pupil at Kashai primary school was found dead while hanging on the door of his shop on Thursday evening. Kagera Regional Police Commander (RPC) Mr Revocatus Malimi named the deceased as Florian Frederick (14), who completed standard seven this year at Kashai Primary School. "The circumstances leading to the death of the pupil are still unclear. The suspect is helping police investigations and he will appear in court when investigations are completed," he said.
