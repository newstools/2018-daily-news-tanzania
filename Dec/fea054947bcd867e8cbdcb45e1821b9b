NATIONAL Bank of Commerce has pushed on with its drive of offering business and financial education to SME players in order to elevate their success. The move, according to the lender, was in order to realize the full potential for SMEs in economic development. Speaking to food and fish mongers at the Kivukoni fish market in Dar es Salaam over the weekend, NBC Acting Head of Marketing and Corporate Relations, Alina Maria Kimaryo said the education helps the traders to keep financial records and manage businesses properly. She said in realisation of the importance of groups, the bank launched Kikundi Mobile product which enables members to channel their contributions straight to the group bank account sans the need to visit bank branches in person. “The Kikundi Mobile account has been simplified because two signatories can authorize group transaction anywhere they are via their mobile handsets without the need to appear at the bank branch,” Ms Kimaryo said. The Head Compliance and Regulatory Affairs, who represented the NBC Managing Director in the event, Ms Sarah Laiser, said apart from the training, the bank also provided material assistance to food vendors, fish mongers and tax collectors at the market, including water tank, fluorescent vests and sanitation tools as part of the bank’s ongoing citizenship agenda. The Chief Executive of the Kivukoni Market, Mkuu Chanje, thanked NBC for the training, noting that business knowledge was crucial for the efficiency and growth of any business enterprise.
