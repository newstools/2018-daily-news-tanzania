IN a bid to foster the Dodoma Green Campaign, Dodoma District yesterday embarked on a massive tree planting project in the capital city. Speaking at the launching ceremony yesterday, the Dodoma District Commissioner, Mr Patrobas Katambi, said that under the plan, every household in Dodoma City would plant three trees in a given compound. “A household which will fail to plant trees in compound will be fined 15,000/- which will be spent on paying city militias who will plant and manage the trees on behalf of the household,” the Dodoma DC said at a media briefing session. Mr Katambi pointed out that all Dodoma-based tertiary institutions will plant 1,000 trees each in their campuses, primary and secondary schools will plant 200 trees and colleges will plant 500 trees. “Public institutions will soon receive letters directing them to also plant trees in their office buildings. I am also encouraging private institutions to join hands with the regional authorities to plant trees in their premises, “ he said. Mr Katambi noted that the project was part of the implementation of directives issued by Vice-President, Samia Suluhu Hassan when she launched Make Dodoma Green initiative in December last year. “Dodoma District will use this rainy season to plant a good number of trees to make our city green,” he said. Mr Katambi said trees provide an abundance of benefits and they give clean air, cleaner water and they are homes to wildlife. While launching the trees planting campaign last year, the Vice-President Samia Suluhu Hassan directed regional and district authorities to pass by-laws, which will ensure household supports the green city programme. The vice president said it was high time the authorities passed laws to support tree planting in each household, school, universities and open places, adding that stern action should be taken against defaulters.
