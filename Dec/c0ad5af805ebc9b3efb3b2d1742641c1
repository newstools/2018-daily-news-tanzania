THE Prosecution from the Immigration Department is expected to bring in three witnesses along with two exhibits in the trial of a case involving a Congolese National, Nasoro Shah Bushiri, who has been living in the country illegally. During the preliminary hearing which was submitted before the Kisutu Resident Magistrate, Janeth Mtega the accused agreed to have entered in the country in 1995 via Kigoma using the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) passport. Along with the passport, the accused had paid 50 US dollars for visa at the border. Bushiri also agreed to have been arrested on February 5, 2018 at Ilala District in Dar es Salaam Region, after being suspected to be an illegal immigrant. The accused also denied names and address written in the charge sheet that he is a citizen of the DR Congo. Bushiri also disagreed that on February 5, 2018 he was brought to Ilala District Immigration Offices in Ilala District in Dar es Salaam, where his statement was taken. And, that on the same date, the accused admitted to have attempted to apply for a resident permit under the names Mwinyi Amis Bushiri, but did not complete the application and acquire the permit. He also denied that he was found living in the country without having a valid visa or any other document authorizing him to do so, since he entered in the country 1995. Earlier on, when the Prosecutor from the Immigration Department, Ms Khadija Masoud had reminded the accused of the two counts including illegal entry and unlawful presence in the country, he denied both charges. However, Magistrate Mtega adjourned the case to February 12, 2019 when the case would appear for the hearing.
