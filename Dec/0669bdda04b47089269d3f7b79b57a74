STRONG demand greeted the treasury bills auctioned on Monday closing the session oversubscribed despite end of year obligations that most investors are fulfilling. The one year government note attracted bids worth 142.08bn/- compared to 141bn/- offered to the market for tendering. However, at the end the government retained 127.32bn/- as successful amount. Most investors in the short term maturities like commercial banks have recently been facing liquidity squeeze affecting directly their investment decision in the treasury bills. The outstanding performance of the session held on Monday this week suggest some improvement of liquidity situation of the investors that despite tax obligations and other year end obligations, still managed to make more investment.
