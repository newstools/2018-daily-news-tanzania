MWANZA based Mbao Head Coach, Amri Said has assured the team’s supporters positive results in their remaining first round Mainland Premier League matches. Mbao have remained with three matches in first round against Mwadui FC at CCM Kirumba Stadium in Mwanza, Kagera Sugar at Kaitaba Stadium in Bukoba and Kinondoni Municipal Council (KMC) at Uhuru Stadium in Dar es Salaam. Amri said his players are well and fit to fight and make sure they are winning the remaining matches at any cost. Mbao failed to register good results in their last four matches but coach Said promised to make sure they will rectify their mistakes before their Saturday’s match against Mwadui FC. He said that for the past few matches the team was struggling in the midfield, saying they need to improve in that department. “The midfield department is struggling… it was visible in our last match against African Lyon whereby they failed to provide balls to strikers,” he said. The match ended in a barren draw at CCM Kirumba last Monday. He called upon the team’s supporters in Mwanza to continue supporting their team, while team captain David Mwassa said they will work hard in training so as to win the matches ahead of them. Mbao, who are sponsored by Gf trucks & equipment are now placed seventh on the log after collecting 21 points from 16 matches. Meanwhile, the league continues today with two matches on card. The day will see JKT Tanzania facing Singida United at Maj Gen Isamuhyo ground, Stand United will test Kagera Sugar at the Kambarage Stadium in Shinyanga.
