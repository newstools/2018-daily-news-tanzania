THE Tanzania Agricultural Research Institute (ARI) in Maruku in Bukoba Rural District is conducting a study on nine banana varieties believed to be rich in vitamin A. Banana Coordinator at ARI Maruku, Dr Shimwela Mpoki, named the varieties to include Apantu, Biira, Lahi, Muracho, Lai, Pisang-papan, Tumbago, Pelipita and Jo’o. “Currently, we are finalising research on nine banana varieties rich in vitamin A. The results will be forwarded to Tanzania Official Seed Certification Institute- Morogoro (TOSCI), which is responsible for field and seed inspection, sampling, seed testing, variety evaluation and verification through NPT, distinctness, uniformity and stability tests (DUS) and control plot testing,” he said. According to Dr Mpoki, the new banana varieties will bring new hopes, where a recent survey indicates that almost 41.7 per cent of children aged below five years in Kagera Region are suffering from malnutrition. The survey also indicates that the rate of stunting stands at 34.7 per cent, underweight at 13.4 per cent, wasting at 3.8 per cent, anaemia among children at 59 per cent, vitamin A deficiency at 33 per cent, anaemia among pregnant women at 53 per cent, while low birth weight (LBW) stands at seven per cent. Kagera Regional Nutrition Development Officer Yusuf Hamis said a national survey conducted last year revealed that Kagera Region was on topped 10 regions in Mainland Tanzania, where malnutrition stood at 41.7 per cent among children aged below five years. Other regions are Dodoma, Mwanza, Kigoma, Mbeya, Dar es Salaam, Geita, Tabora, Ruvuma and Lindi.
