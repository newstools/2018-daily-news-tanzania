A CONTINGENT of 34 people from Magnet Youth Sports Organisation (MYSO) left the country yesterday for a weeklong football clinic in Johannesburg, South Africa. Speaking to the ‘Daily News on Saturday’ shortly before boarding a plane at Julius Nyerere International Airport (JNIA), MYSO Chairman Tuntufye Mwambusi said the trip would help a lot the organisation’s youths to acquire extra football skills from renowned instructors in South Africa. “We have specifically been invited by Transitional Football Academy, one of the respected academies in South Africa after enjoying a successful relationship with them for the past three years and this is among the products of our strong friendship with them,” Mwambusi said. He added that while in South Africa, tomorrow, they will get a chance to witness a tournament organised by their hosts which brings together all their branches in the country under one roof on top of playing friendly games with other competitive academies with some of them shown on DStv. “At MYSO, we believe that talent is developed from the tender age that is why we are travelling from one place to another as a means to learn more on how our colleagues manage and run their facilities so that we can as well borrow new ideas for our benefit. “When we come back, trust me, these guys will not be the same again and they will share the learnt skills with their friends who failed to travel,” he said. He further lauded the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) and the National Sports Council (NSC) for blessing their journey, while at the same time thanking parents and guardians of the youth, who made the trip for their support and understanding.
