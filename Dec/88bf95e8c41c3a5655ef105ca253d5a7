YOUTHS in big cities and towns have been advised to engage in vegetable farming to cater for the huge demand that guarantees sustainable income. This was said by Mr Malembo Lucas, an Agribusiness consultant in Dar es Salaam during a Nafanikiwa inspirational session that brought together around two hundred youths from all walks of life in Dar es Salaam over the weekend with the aim of transforming their minds with entrepreneurship skills. “I started by growing an acre of Chinese cabbage and earned 3m/- after investing not more than 600,000/-,” said Mr Lucas adding that vegetable farming requires low investment but has high returns. Mr Lucas who is doing his farming activities in Kigamboni area said that all one needs is getting land which for his part was leased at 100,000/- only for two consecutive seasons and therefore no need of owning one. Other needed investment to have the crop ready for market included buying manure, seeds and irrigation tools as the farm needs to be closer to an area with access to water for irrigation. The consultant insisted that there were no need to worry about market availability as vegetable market is plenty available as its demand grows by 12 per cent annually and that its produce can be easily sold anywhere. “There are people who don’t have time going to the market, the youth can sell the vegetables at different locations like bus stops, road junctions and even in traffic jam areas as the demand is high,” he said. According to him, vegetables is an emergent meal that can also be grown at one’s own labour without employing additional one and that once planted can continuously be harvested the whole year as long as the plot is carefully maintained.
