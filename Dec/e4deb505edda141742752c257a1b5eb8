Land officers in Manyara Region have been advised to increase speed in their work because they are too slow, leading to citizens failing to get their rights on time. Hanang District Commissioner (DC), Mr Joseph Mkirikiti, said here recently that he was aware that the officers were working in good faith, but asked them to do more in order to go with the pace of the fifth phase government. DC Mkirikiti was speaking at a regional land officersâ€™ meeting that was discussing, among other things, implementation of the resolutions passed in the last meeting and forge the way forward. It was found that at least 60 per cent of the agreements were in good course, especially on issuing correct information regarding land. He said that land officers and town planners are people in the best position to spearhead development and create employment to different people because they are the ones responsible to earmark and show those responsible on where to construct industries. Mr Mkirikiti said it was high time land experts use their proficiency in ensuring correct land use is put into practice so that productivity starts and is increased from time to time and land conflicts become a thing of the past. Manyara Regional Deputy Administrative Secretary (RAS), Infrastructure, Ms Sumatumpale Mwakasitu called upon land officers in the region to make sure that different government and religious institutions get title deeds for their land and do the same for nongovernmental ones as a way to avoid land conflicts now and in the future.
