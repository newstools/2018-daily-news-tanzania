WOMEN in Law and Development Africa (WiLDAF) has asked the judiciary to support non-state actors to influence the National Assembly to enact the Domestic Violence Act and also establish family courts. The call was made at the weekend by WiLDAF board member Nakazael Tenga during a moot court organised by Association of women Judges (TAWJA) and WiLDAF held at Law School premises in Dar es Salaam. “We need a standalone domestic Violence Act as the current Penal Code does not incorporate some forms of domestic violence and the treatment of victims of gender-based violence,” said Ms Tenga. She asked the judiciary to support them in their efforts to end gender-based violence (GBV) by prioritising the establishment of family courts to speed up cases especially those related to GBV “because justice delayed is justice denied.” She said during the 16 days of activism they had a special team of practising advocates in five regions, offering legal aid in the workplace to help women access legal aid,” she said. This year’s 16 days of activism against GBV was officially launched in Dodoma by Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa under the theme “Open Up, Her Safety My Responsibility”. Ms Tenga said the theme “Her Safety My Responsibility” emphasised the role bestowed on everyone to protect especially women and girls against any form of violence, adding that the theme focused on how GBV occurred in society, schools and the workplace.
