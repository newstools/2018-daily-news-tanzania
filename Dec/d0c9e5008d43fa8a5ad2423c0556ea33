PENSIONERS in the country have every reason to smile as President John Magufuli yesterday ordered that the formula that was used to calculate retirement benefits before the merger of social security funds be used until 2023. Dr Magufuli announced his decision during a meeting he convened at State House in Dar es Salaam with representatives of workers’ associations led by Trade Union Congress of Tanzania (TUCTA), Social Security Regulatory Authority (SSRA), government officials and other stakeholders. Before issuing his government’s position and directives on the matter that caused furore among pensioners and workers, President Magufuli gave an opportunity to workers’ leaders to give their views on the new pension calculation formula. After the merger, the country has remained with two pension funds, the Public Service Social Security Fund (PSSSF) and National Social Security Fund (NSSF) with the former accommodating civil servants while the latter is for those in the private sector. His decision has cleared confusion and grievances from workers regarding the new formula that directed pensioners to start receiving 25 per cent of their savings in lump sum, while the remaining 75 per cent will be paid in monthly instalments as it was announced by Social Security Regulatory Authority (SSRA). “Due to the confusion, I have decided that we shall have a transitional period that will end in 2023, and in between all retirees will receive their pension according to previous pension calculations formula of their respective pension funds,” said Dr Magufuli. During his speech, Dr Magufuli instructed that all civil servants who were registered in NSSF should be transferred to PSSSF and same to employees from private sector, who are in PSSSF will have to be transferred to NSSF. “This is a requirement of the law and we will have to do this as soon as possible, he said, instructing the Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office (Policy, Parliamentary Affairs, Labour, Employment, Youth, and the Disabled) Jenista Mhagama to supervise the process. The Head of State also tasked government officials and SSRA to use this transition period to formulate the best formula, which will replace the existing one, and have the retirees paid 50 per cent in lump sum, and the rest in monthly instalments.
