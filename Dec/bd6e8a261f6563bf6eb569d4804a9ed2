THE government yesterday explained ongoing measures to revive the Air Tanzania Company (ATCL), including repairing two old planes and modernising the major maintenance hangar located at Kilimanjaro International Airport (KIA). It is expected that once the maintenance hangar is modernised and fully equipped, The maintenance of aircrafts be done within Tanzania instead of sending them to countries like Ethiopia or South Africa. The briefing was made by Works, Transport and Communications Minister Isack Kamwelwe yesterday at an event to receive the Airbus 220-300 at the Julius Nyerere International Airport (JNIA). He told the gathering that while the government was still purchasing new aircrafts, plans were afoot to make major repairs on the two old ones to enable the ATCL operate more planes. He said the ministry had allocated $3 million for the maintenance of the two places. Meanwhile, the ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Dr Leonard Chamuriho, explained that from 2016, the ATCL had recorded notable achievements. From 2016 to this year, the company had increased the number of pilots from 11 to 56. The number of aircraft engineers and technicians had also increased to 87 from 31 over the same period. On other hand, the company now records a total of 34,000 passengers travelling by its planes per month, up from only 5600. According to him, the new Airbus 220-300 which was received yesterday has a capacity of carrying 132 passengers. He said the coming of the Airbus 220-300 puts the ATCL in a good position to introduce new routes within and outside the country. Among others, the company looks forward to introducing new foreign routes to Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa and within the country in Mpanda, Pemba, Kahama, Shinyanga and others. “The coming of this plane proves what the President always stresses; that we (Tanzanians) can,” National Assembly Speaker Job Ndugai remarked. He asked the board of directors of ATCL to work hard, to ensure that revenues are increased.
