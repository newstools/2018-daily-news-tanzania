THE government has been urged to empower rural girls to enable them to participate fully in the industrial economy. Speaking in the region recently, Dodoma Inter-African Committee (DIAC) Director Jenipher Chiute said empowering rural girls was crucial for them to address challenges facing them. Ms Chiute said most of the rural girls were subjected to different forms of GBV, pointing out that studies conducted by her NGO in rural areas established that some girls were denied access to education. She said DIAC, in cooperation with regional authorities, sought to liberate rural girls from all forms of GBV and other forms of violence, including female genital mutilation (FGM). Ms Chiute noted that DIAC was set up to implement programmes aimed at curbing archaic traditional practices such as FGM and early marriage. “We are also working round the clock to sensitise members of the public to enable the girl child to access education and support her to get education,” she noted.
