INSTITUTE of Rural Development Planning (IRDP) plans to put up a leather factory in Idifu, Chamwino District. IRDP Deputy Director of Academic, Research and Consultancy, Prof Israel Katega, said yesterday preparations for the construction of a modern plant for shoes, sandals, handbags and wallets were in progress. He said the EU fundedconstruction project worth 2bn/- would commence early next year. “Preliminary work for the mega project, including designing the facility has been completed.” Prof Katega said plans were underway to acquire modern leather processing machines from abroad, saying the facility would have modern equipment to manufacture best leather products. He noted that the plant would stimulate economic development and create direct and indirect job opportunities in the region. Prof Katega explained that it would also enable pastoralists to double their incomes by selling hides to the facility. The construction of the leather plant comes at a right time due to high demand of leather products in recent years. Currently, most of dried hides from Dodoma Region are sold to Arusha and Morogoro traders at between 3,000/- and 4,000/- for a cow hide and at between 1,000/- and 1,500/- for a goat hide.
