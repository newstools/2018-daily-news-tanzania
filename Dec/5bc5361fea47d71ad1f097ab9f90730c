South Africa's state prosecuting authority has issued an arrest warrant for Grace Mugabe, Zimbabwe's former first lady, the Times Live news website is reporting. Mrs Mugabe was accused of assaulting a young model, Gabriella Engels, in a hotel in South Africa's main city, Johannesburg, in 2017. She was allowed to return home after she applied for diplomatic immunity -but in july this year a court annulled a goverment  decision to grant her immunity. Mrs Mugabe said at the time that she had acted in self-defence after the "intoxicated and unhinged" model attacked her in a hotel room where her two sons lived. Times Live says the lobby group AfriForum, which has been pursuing the case, made the announcement about the arrest warrant at a press conference on Wednesday Morning. It quotes AfriForum CEO Kallie Kriel as saying: “It seems that justice is going to take place and we are looking forward to this matter going forward.” The alleged assault took place about three months before the military takeover in Zimbabwe which saw Robert Mugabe resign as president after 37 years in power.
