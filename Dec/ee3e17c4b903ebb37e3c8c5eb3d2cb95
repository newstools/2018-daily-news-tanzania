ARIEL Glaser Paediatric Aids Healthcare Initiative (Agpahi)’s work in enlightening parents, guardians and society to live with infected children in their midst deserves praise. That was said in Dar es Salaam yesterday by Tanzania Commission for Aids (Tacaids) Acting Director National Response Audrey Njelekela, while presiding at Agpahi’s launch of Ariel Club Camp 2018 in the city. She further said the NGO’s work of assuring children living with HIV/Aids that life did not end with infection was a positive way of fighting against stigma and incorporating them in society for them to realise their dreams. “The club you have initiated will further address stigma and encourage post life living…even if a child has lost a parent or both parents as well as to encourage them to face life challenges ahead of them,” she said in a speech she read on behalf of Tacaids Executive Director, Dr Leonard Maboko. She said Agpahi’s role in linking children with health facilities, where they got access to ARVs was prolonging their lives, despite some of them not being aware of why they were taking daily doses as children. “Good reliance on ARVs prescription will make children become future doctors, pilots, educationists and even one becoming a president and we must live with them,” added Ms Njelekela. Hailing the historical background of the club, Acting Director National Response further said they should be spread countrywide because they taught children living with HIV/ Aids how to avoid new infections as well as the general public. Agpahi Community Linkage Programme Officer Madina Mukulu highlighted how her organisation had started psychosocial support to children living with HIV/Aids in 2011 in Shinyanga, Mara, Mwanza and Simiyu with about 50 children.
