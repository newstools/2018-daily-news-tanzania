DEPUTY Minister for Works, Transport and Communication, Atashasta Nditiye has directed the management of Air Tanzania Company Limited (ATCL) to improve its marketing department and identify staff and agents sabotaging the company. The Deputy Minister issued the directive at the ATCL workers council that met in Morogoro Region on Wednesday. He said there have been allegations of ATCL staff to collude with agents in order to sabotage the state-run carrier particularly for Kilimanjaro and Mbeya routes by telling travellers that ATCL planes are fully booked. “Some agents selling ATCL tickets are colluding with other airlines to divert travellers to take other flights because ATCL is fully booked,” he said. Mr Nditiye added, “ATCL services are the best with affordable air tickets and backed by youngest fleet,”he said. He suggested that to address the problem, ATCL management should improve its marketing department in order to identify all ill-will plans intended to sabotage the state run airline company operations in the country. He commended the ATCL management for completing the process of initiating two direct flights on weekly basis to Dodoma from Dar es Salaam this month. He said so far ATCL is having four planes including three Dash 8 Q400 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner
