SETTING quality standards in the manufacturing sector can help local goods penetrate and compete in the regional and international markets. “Manufacture of high quality goods is important in unlocking huge market potentials and drive up the country’s industrialisation agenda,” said Mr Daryosh Dabiri, the manager of sketchers shop in Dar es Salaam over the weekend. He said completion in business for locally produced goods is important because it provides reassurance in getting customers because of the quality of the products and services. “It is important that the new industries established are provided with guidelines on quality standards of the goods to be produced for ease penetration in the regional and global markets,” he added. He said there are immense opportunities in many sectors for every citizen to grab and invest in the industrial sector with the ultimate goal to contribute to the economic growth. He said local manufacturers can borrow a leaf on sketchers products which have quality standards needed for making physical exercises and confirmed by health experts thus enabling them to penetrate the Tanzania market and other regional markets. “Local manufacturers have the ability to produce high quality products to meet the standards needed in order to compete and fetch more revenue,” he noted. On her part, the marketing manager Ms Nasra Mohammed said competition in the market should be given priority for smooth business flow. “In order to compete in the market, manufacturers should invest more in quality standards that will give assurance in the local market and penetrate easily in foreign markets,” she said.
