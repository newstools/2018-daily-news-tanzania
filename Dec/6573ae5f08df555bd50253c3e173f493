THE fight against illegal immigrants requires cooperation between authorities and members of the public, the government has said. The cooperation, apart from reducing criminal activities related to the illegal immigration, will also help protect and maintain the country’s security. This was said yesterday by the Deputy Minister for Home Affairs, Engineer Hamad Masauni as the country marked the International Migrants Day. The day is marked on every 18 th day of December every year. This year’s theme is ‘Migration with Dignity’. In Tanzania, the day was marked yesterday for the first time, with the government pledging to keep marking the date every year. “As we are marking this day, Tanzania will continue to adhere to the laws as well as providing security to all migrants who are coming legally, but the arrest of illegal migrants and their agents requires support from all citizens,” he said. He also said that efforts have been taken to apprehend all people who are bringing illegal migrants into the country. The deputy minister said that the government welcomes all legal migrants like investors, tourists, specialists and students. Earlier, the Commissioner General of Immigration (CGI), Dr Anna Makakala said her department is committed to ensure that all foreigners who are coming in Tanzania have legal permits. She said the government is doing everything possible to digitize immigration services and ease the processes applied on issuing visa and other permits. Present at the event was the Assistant Director of Refugees Services in the Ministry of Home Affairs, Mr Suleiman Mziray, who said so far the country is hosting 320,000 refugees who are in Nduta, Nyarugusu and Mtendeli camps in Kigoma and Katavi regions. “27 7 ,000 of them are from Burundi and 67 ,000 are Congolese, this is proof that Tanzania is adhering to the international contracts and we shall continue with that,” he said.
