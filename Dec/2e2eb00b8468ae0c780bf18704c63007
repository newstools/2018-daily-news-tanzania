TANZANIA has explained reasons for backing Kenya’s push for a position at the United Nation Security Council (UNSC) for the 2021-2022 term. The reasons are not only based on the fact that Kenya and Tanzania share good relations and a growing trade associations, but also the country has proven success in promoting peace, prosperity and humanitarian service. “Kenya hosts a big number of refugees from conflicted countries of South Sudan and Somalia; it receives and offers hospitality services to a number of foreign tourists from different countries around the world. It has also succeeded in combating terrorism and it still dispatches its army officers to peace keeping missions to troubled neighbours, and as such it deserves a seat at the UN,” said Amb Agustine Mahiga, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and East Africa Cooperation. He was speaking during celebrations to mark the 55th Kenyan independence at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Dar es Salaam on Wednesday night. Speaking at the occasion, Kenya’s high Commissioner to Tanzania, Dan Kazungu, said that the two countries share historical diplomatic relations and that they are meant to be long lasting. He added that Kenya’s doors are open to all Africans for visiting, living and even marrying Kenyan nationals. “When in Kenya, you will be treated as Kenyans with no unnecessary disturbances,” he insisted. Kenya is vying for the seat at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) from 2021 to 2022, where all of the six East African Community Member states have pledged to support their bid. Other supporters include China and Namibia, and the country is looking for support from other members of the UNSC.
