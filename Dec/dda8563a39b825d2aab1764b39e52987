MINISTER of State in the Second Vice-President’s Office Mohamed Aboud Mohamed has said interinstitutional collaboration against drug abuse and trafficking remains one of the stringent measures to fight against the problem in the country. He said drug abuse and trafficking in Zanzibar were still a big challenge that needed concerted effort and commitment to controlling to save the youth from getting involved in it. “We must work together to win the war on drug use and business. It seems there is still a gap that hampers the struggle against the problem,” Mr Mohamed noted. He said at a meeting on illegal drugs that the government was committed to ensuring drug abuse and trafficking were fought against to minimise the effects they had on the youth and national development. The minister said the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)’s survey in 2015 showed Zanzibar had about 10,000 drug users, including 3,200 of them using syringes. Participants in the meeting, which brought together public officials, police officers, prosecutors, magistrates and investigators, said they needed to intensify a campaign against drug use. According to Anti-drugs Commission Executive Director Kheriyangu Ngeni Khamis, there is a need for collaboration to win the war on the use and sale of narcotic drugs for “many young people are being affected.”
