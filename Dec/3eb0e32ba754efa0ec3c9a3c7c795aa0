WHILE nine regions have selected all candidates who passed the 2018 Standard Seven National Examinations to join Form One next year in public schools, the fate of 133,747 pupils remains unclear. Minister of State in the President’s Office, Regional Administration and Local Government, Suleiman Jafo announced the selection in Dar es Salaam yesterday, directing all Regional Commissioners (RCs) whose regions have shortage of classrooms to ensure the required infrastructure is in place by next February to accommodate the pupils. He said the 133,747 candidates, equivalent to 18.24 per cent of the 733,103 candidates who passed the national examinations missed the opportunity to study in government schools due to classroom shortage. The minister commended Dar es Salaam, Geita, Kilimanjaro, Mtwara, Morogoro, Mwanza, Ruvuma, Singida and Songwe regions, which have managed to accommodate all the candidates who passed the exams. He said 599,356 candidates—81.24 per cent—of the 733,103 pupils who sat for the 2018 national exams, have been selected to join government schools next year. “Let me take this opportunity to congratulate all candidates, teachers, parents and guardians for their efforts to reach this stage. I hereby direct all regional commissioners to ensure all government schools have the requisite infrastructures in place by February next year to allow all qualified pupils to join secondary education,” charged Mr Jafo. Arusha, with 18,719 pupils missing the admission, tops the list of regions, with serious classroom shortage. Mara comes second with 16,365 victims of the educational infrastructure shortage. Other regions that failed to admit all qualified students to secondary education with the number of pupils who were left in brackets are Kagera (14,046), Simiyu (12,684), Kigoma (12,178), Tabora (11,209), Mbeya (6,395), Shinyanga (6,271), Dodoma (5,991), Tanga (5,400) and Manyara (5,392). Others are Rukwa (4,930), Coast (4,731), Njombe (3,172), Iringa (2,774),), and Lindi (1,294) and Katavi (1,249). Minister Jafo called on all selected candidates to use the educational opportunity well for their future benefits. He also directed teachers and education practitioners in all levels to increase efforts in managing and monitoring the provision of education to improve the sector in the country. Mr Jafo asked the municipal councils in collaboration with education stakeholders countrywide to complete construction and maintenance of infrastructures to create enabling environment for all selected candidates to study well and hard. “I direct all regions and municipal councils countrywide to make regular follow-ups in schools to ensure all qualified candidates are selected to join public secondary schools,” he added.
