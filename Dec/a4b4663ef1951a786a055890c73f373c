DEPUTY Minister for Agriculture, Mr Innocent Bashungwa has revealed that the establishment of Crop Stabilisation Fund (CSF) will save farmers from falling coffee prices, while at the same time enable them get attractive deals. Mr Bashungwa, who is also MP for Karagwe hinted that the government was working on modalities that will enable coffee farmers in Kagera Region to get second payment. “We are still working on the matter. But, I am optimistic that the farmers will get some payment as plans were being finalised to conduct auctions in Kagera Region starting next crop buying season,” he said. He, however, challenged farmers to increase coffee production before appealing to Tanzania Coffee Research Institute (TACRI), to multiply improved coffee seedlings and supply them to farmers for the planting season. “Concerted efforts were needed to increase the number of coffee farmers from the current 130,000, taking into consideration that the region has a population of about 2.8 million,” he said. Starting next season, coffee auctions will be held in Kagera Region. This step has been taken to avoid rampant thefts that resulted in farmers getting meagre income. The private sector has also been allowed to participate in the auction and buy the crop at competitive prices. During his recent tour of Kagera Region, the Prime Minister Mr Kassim Majaliwadirected Cooperative Unions to ensure that by October 20, this year, all payments to coffee farmers should be cleared while by October 30 all coffee should have been collected from the villages. Mr Majaliwa said the directives were issued by the government, saying all farmers will have to follow the new system, which requires them to sell their coffee through cooperative unions in their areas. We are doing this basically to protect farmers from exploitation and ensure that they are getting fair prices.
