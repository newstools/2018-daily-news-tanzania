EVERTON boss Marco Silva will take his Everton squad to Africa next summer to play a showpiece friendly against the next winners of the SportPesa Cup. The Blues became the first Premier League club in 2017 to play a friendly match in Tanzania, beating Kenyan SportPesa Premier League champions Gor Mahia FC 2-1 in front of a crowd of more than 40,000 at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam. The Club plans to return once again to the continent to contest the SportPesa Trophy against the winners of the 2019 SportPesa Cup. While in Tanzania in 2017 the Blues, alongside SportPesa, won hearts and minds in the region when they participated in a range of promotional and charitable activities across Dar es Salaam. The Club further strengthened its links with African football when welcoming Gor Mahia last month to Goodison Park to contest the 2018 SportPesa Trophy, winning 4-0. The match was also used to raise funds for the Club’s official charity, Everton in the Community, with proceeds from ticket sales helping to support the development of its 40 social programmes across Merseyside. The date and venue for next year’s SportPesa Trophy has yet to be confirmed and fans are advised not to book travel or accommodation until full details are announced. The Blues will face the winners of the eight-team SportPesa Cup, featuring four teams from Kenya (SPL champions Gor Mahia, second-placed Bandari FC, SportPesa Shield winners Kariobangi Sharks and AFC Leopards) and four teams from Tanzania (the 2017/18 Mainland Premier League champions Simba SC, Young Africans SC, Singida United and Mbao FC).
