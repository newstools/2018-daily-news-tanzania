VODACOM Tanzania has rewarded its customers in this festive season with 1bn/- through a new programme known as Tuzo points. “This is part of the mobile firm’s ongoing initiative to show appreciation to its customers for their loyalty,” said Hisham Hendi, Vodacom Tanzania’s Acting Managing Director in the press conference held in Dar es Salaam yesterday. He explained that Tuzo points to Vodacom customers are earned whenever they recharge airtime or perform a charged M-Pesa (Mobile Money) transactions. The first mobile firm to be listed at the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) Vodacom Tanzania has the largest market share with over 13 million subscriptions and over 13.2 million registered customers, as reported in the latest by the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA). He said the points are able to be redeemed by converting them to their M-Pesa wallet, purchase bundles, as well as to purchase different products. “Customers are rewarded with 50 Tuzo points for every 500/- they recharge. The Tuzo points can be accumulated for 12 months from time they were earned and will expire if unused within a 12-month period,” he said. The acting Managing Director revealed that the programme of awarding customers through Tuzo points was motivated by the fact that Vodacom Tanzania revenues have increased by 6 per cent this year and the growth and therefore this is a glimpse of gratitude to them. He said that customers should expect to benefit more as they perform transaction during the festive season. “Throughout the year, our customers have been our central focus and they are at the heart of all our innovations. Vodacom Tanzania is committed to provide our customers with the best customer experience,” Hisham said.
