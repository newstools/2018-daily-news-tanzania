2018 is a banner year for young driver Tufail Amin Tufail after he and his navigator Victor Jackson claimed the Group S Championship after the end of the Mount Uluguru Rally held in Morogoro over the weekend. The eighth round of this year’s National Rally Championship (NRC), Mount Uluguru Rally was also the final motorsports event of this year, according to the calendar of the Automobile Association of Tanzania (AAT). Tufail who drivers Subaru N8, managed to claim podium finish in seven out of all eight rounds staged this season, something he calls a big a achievement. “It was a brilliant season for me and team mates, we fought hard in all rounds and eventually we snatched the Group S title. I thank my fans, sponsors and my parents for their huge backing,” said Tufail. He said he was looking for brighter season in 2019 as he believes his driving skills then will be much improved. He said his biggest upset was of Mzizima Rally held in Kigamboni, Dar es Salaam. “I faced several challenges that at the end forced me retire prematurely. Mechanical problems and inclement of weather were the major obstacles,” he said. After the end of the last round, Iringa’s Ahmed Huwel who emerged the overall winner and Gurjit Dhani from Kilimanjaro, who claimed the Group N title season, were also decorated in the season ender. The 27-year-old Tufail indeed lived to the billing with a sublime performance that created as much debate. He competed in Uganda in his Subaru GC8 driver and convincingly posted the second fastest times in all day one’s three stages before his car suffered overheating that forced him out of the rally. He thanked sponsors Shamshu Impex, ISM Stationary, Siera Zulu, Angata Camp,Maji Poa, the Branded Store and Tufail Autoworks for their vital assistance. Profile: Tufail Amin Tufail.
