AS part of global efforts to control non-communicable diseases (NCDs), President Ali Mohamed Shein has urged women to go for voluntary cervical cancer screening. In his brief speech at the launch of a four-year anticervical cancer campaign, Dr Shein said it was a rare opportunity for women aged 25-65 because for those, who would test positive would be treated free of charge. “I urge all eligible women to ‘take charge’ and be screened,” the President said as he thanked Jiangsu Provincial Commission of Health and Family Planning for carrying out the project to be implemented at Mnazi Mmoja Referral Hospital in Unguja and at Abdalla Mzee Hospital in Pemba. He said the China backed cervical cancer screening project was an additional to other ongoing programmes aimed at minimising cancer problems in the country (Tanzania), where about 35,000 women were screened positive with cervical cancer annually, according to Ocean Road Cancer Hospital data. Dr Shein said cervical cancer was among the big challenges facing women and the government was doing all what it could to implement programmes for screening and treatment, “But we advise members of the public to support the programme by avoiding risk factors like smoking, reckless eating and having regular physical exercises.” Medical doctors from China Jiangsu Provincial Commission of Health and Family Planning promised to implement a cervical cancer screening programme successfully, urging women not to be afraid because testing was done safely. Speaking at the cervical cancer screening launch at Idriis Abdulwakil Multipurpose Hall, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Health, Asha Ali Abdalla said the programme targeted to screen at least 35,000 women by 2022. She said early and regular screening could help improve health outcomes because treatment succeeded well, when detected earlier. She said the awareness campaign had been going on along with human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination for teenagers aged 9-14.
