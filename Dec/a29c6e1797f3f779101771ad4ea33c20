TANZANIANS Victor Joseph and Adam Abbas will join other East Africa’s top golfers in a race for Nyali Open Golf Championship, the World Amateur Ranking event in Mombasa, Kenya. The 54-hole competition, the last round of the 2018 Kenya Amateur Golf Championship (KAGC) series tees off tomorrow at Nyali Golf & Country Club in Mombasa. Joseph who is a household name in KAGC event heads to Mombasa after missed a chance to defend Rwanda Open title in Kigali due to financial constraints. Joseph, the national team captain, said he was looking forward to win his second title in Kenya after claiming Muthaiga Open title early this year in Nairobi. Joseph who was in his way to Mombasa yesterday said: “My desire is always the same, to win titles and lure sponsorship for further training abroad.” He said that has set his sights at Nyali, hoping to end the year in sound note. Joseph is not a stranger to Nyali course and he will want to take from where he left last year when his sparking form earned him overall second title. Joseph said he wants to show what gives him string performance which early this year helped him finish five shots behind the champion, Kenyan Daniel Nduva. He carded 224 total strokes (79,72,73) to finish second behind South Africa-based Nduva, who is also a member of Nyali Club, who penned 219 strokes (73,71,75) to win Nyali Open. For some reasons Abbas has been a forgotten name in this year’s local and international events, but he still has a chance to improve at Nyali Open. The KAGC series final event tees alongside the Sigona Bowl at the Sigona Golf Club and winds up at the scenic Nyali Golf Club. Kenya Golf Union (KGU) will award the country’s top amateur golfer in the two-day event. A field of 84 golfers the Tanzanian dup are already there. Others include Uganda’s Joel Basalaine and Joseph Chinywai. Also in the list are John Karichu, Simon Njogu, Mathew Wahome, Edwin Mudanyi, Samuel Njoroge, and George Felix who are expected to offer a strong challenge.
