A serious shortage of classrooms in the region is likely to lock out more than 18,000 students who are set to join Form One next year. The fate of the 18,719 pupils who sat for their standard seven national exams this year still remains unclear following a shortage of 374 classrooms that has hit the region recently. Speaking yesterday during the 2019 Form One Selection exercise here, Arusha Regional Education Officer (REO), Gift Kyando said those to be affected by the crisis are 8,760 male and 9,959 female students, which equates to 57 per cent of the total students who will not make it to the next level. “Such drastic times call for strong measures per the directive by the minister responsible for regional administration and local government,” remarked the REO in a meeting that was chaired by the Ngorongoro District Commissioner, Mr Rashid Taka. Speaking in a similar exercise held in Dar es Salaam on Thursday, Minister of State in the President’s Office, Regional Administration and Local Government, Selemani Jafo directed all regional commissioners whose regions experience shortage of classrooms to ensure the required infrastructure is in place by next February to accommodate the students. Mr Jafo singled out Dar es Salaam, Geita, Kilimanjaro, Mtwara, Morogoro, Mwanza, Ruvuma, Singida and Songwe as the only regions that had managed to accommodate all the candidates who passed the exams. “I hereby direct all regional commissioners to ensure all government schools have the requisite infrastructure in place by February to allow all qualified pupils to join secondary education,” ordered the minister. Such a directive could be a bitter pill to swallow for Arusha, a region which has recently registered an 87 per cent of students who passed this year’s standard seven national examinations. “We cannot afford seeing the selected students miss out on schools just because of the shortage of classrooms,” remarked the REO.
