TANZANIA Revenue Authority (TRA) Commissioner General Charles Kichere said yesterday that his office was strengthening systems that will enable it to collect more revenues and smoothen the environment of doing business. He said the authority collected a total of 42.9trl/- in the past three years and that it was looking forward to collecting more money in the coming years. He was speaking during a meeting officiated by President John Magufuli. The meeting brought together TRA officials from different regions, Regional Commissioners, Regional Administrative Secretaries and other heads of government agencies and leaders. On his side, the BoT Governor Prof Florence Luoga (pictured) said the central bank was making a close follow-up on the operations of the various banks across the country. He said the bank was also monitoring the performance of forex shops by ensuring proper registration and licencing. Minister for Finance and Planning Dr Philip Mpango said his office was ready to implement all directives issued by the Head of State for the betterment of majority Tanzanians. “We are always ready to implement the President’s directives. We are urging all officials to deposit the money into the government account and make sure they avoid giving tax exemptions to investors without making thorough consultations,” he said.
