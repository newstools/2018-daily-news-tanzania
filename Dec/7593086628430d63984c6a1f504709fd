ROADS, bridges and large buildings are next on the list of infrastructural projects that are susceptible to global warming and related effects of climate change. Engineers from East and Southern African countries gathering in Arusha have stated here that, effects of climate change have started to take toll onto infrastructural projects, including high-rise buildings, roads, bridges and communication pillars, thus drastic steps need to be taken to curb the trend. The United Nations (UN Environment) Country Representative, Ms Clara Makenya, said local engineers’ works have direct impacts on ordinary citizens and that as the world experiences rising temperatures, stakeholders need to come together to ensure that infrastructural projects under their care withstand future effects of climatic change. “There are new technologies that ensure all engineering works can endure negative weather elements such as massive flooding, earthquake, extreme temperatures and hailstorms,” said Ms Makenya. Speaking at the 11th International Engineers’ Conference on the roles of engineers in addressing climate change, challenges and opportunities, the President of the Institution of Engineers in Tanzania, Eng Ngwisa Mpembe, who also presides over the East African Chapter of Engineers’ union, said there was a need to harmonise their working strategies and blueprints. On his part, the President of Confederation of Rwanda Engineers, Engineer Kazawadi Papias, said their South African counterparts were more advanced in making their infrastructural projects resilient to effects of climate change and other weather elements, and so East African countries could learn from them. “When roads, bridges and houses collapse due to floods or earthquakes, it is taxpayers’ money that gets lost, causing economic disaster to any nation and that is why we need to get prepared now, because global warming and climate change effects are here to stay and likely to get worse,” said Papias. A total of 220 civil engineers from Rwanda, Uganda, South Africa and the host Tanzania are participating in the conference, which is also being attended by constructors as well as students from a number of higher learning institutions.
