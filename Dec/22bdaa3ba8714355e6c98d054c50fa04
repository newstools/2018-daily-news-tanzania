MICHAEL Wambura yesterday officially resumed his vice presidency job after the High Court revoked a life ban sentence imposed to him by Tanzania Football Federation’s Ethics Committee. The federation’s Ethics Committee slapped Wambura the life ban that restricted him from involving himself in any football activities, before the High Court revoked it and reinstated him to his former position. Wambura presented the ruling to the federation’s official during his visit to the federation headquarters, however, the federation’s top officials, including the president, Wallace Karia and the secretary general, Wilfred Kidao were not in office to welcome him. Wambura disclosed that he will also present the ruling letter to the World football governing body (FIFA) and that presenting the court letter that revokes the federation decision was to prove that he was officially back in the office as the federation’s Vice-President and the chairman of Football Association of Mara (FAM). He further said that after presenting the court ruling letter to the federation, Wambura unveiled that he was also looking forward to meet the Minister for Information, Culture, Arts and Sports Harrison Mwakyembe and present himself to him the court ruling that reinstated him to his former post. Last Friday in Dar es Salaam, the High Court Judge, Benhajji Masoud ruling officially revoked the decision of the Ethics Committee to slap Wambura a life ban. The ruling means Wambura has retained both posts; TFF Vice-Presidency and Mara regional football body chairmanship It also means the end of tenure for Athumani Nyamlani who was later appointed as Acting Vice President after Wambura ban. March this year, TFF Ethics Committee under the tutelage of Hamidu Mbwezeleni imposed a life ban to Wambura that prohibits him from involving himself in any football activity after it found him guilty of three charges, including forgery, embezzlement of TFF funds and tarnishing of the federation image.
