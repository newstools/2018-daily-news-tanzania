RETIRED judge Mark Bomani has challenged Tanzania People’s Defence Forces (TPDF) Lugalo Golf Club of Dar es Salaam to take the game by storm and conquer Africa as they have all it takes to go further. Bomani, who was chief guest at the Waitara Trophy Golf Championship held at the course in Dar es Salaam over the weekend, said that he acknowledges all the efforts have been taken since introduction of the course 12 years ago to promote the game. He said that Lugalo Club and Tanzania Golf Union (TGU) have been doing wonderful job to end the notion that golf is a game for rich people and for foreigners. “We have already moved ahead and nowadays golf is played by all people, the today’s tournament is a good testimony. But these efforts should be sustained so that the game can be easily accessible to many Tanzanians,” he said. “Golf has taken a new dimension, from now on should be forward ever, backward never,” he stressed. He said that efforts to invest on juniors can produce future Tanzania Tiger Woods, therefore must be enhanced. He said the club leads in having youth development programmes that involve players from very young age most of them underprivileged. Bomani who started playing golf while working in Zambia, had frequently met the former President Kenneth Kaunda, one of the people who influenced him to play golf. Bomani urged firms and individuals to invest in golf infrastructure by constructing more golf courses, at least in every regional centre.
