The tournament which features teams from Under-7 to U-20 categories from the East African region, will take place at the TGT Grounds from December 11 to 16 this year. Organised by the Arusha-based Future Stars Academy, the ninth edition of the ‘Chipukizi Cup’ football tournament had by yesterday received confirmation of 130 teams from within and outside the country. According to Future Stars Academy Director Alfred Itaeli, Kenya will feature the most in the tourney having 80 teams, followed by the hosts Tanzania with 40 teams while Uganda and Zanzibar will have 7 and 3 outfits respectively. “Preparations are at an advanced stage and we are pleased to inform you that some countries have confirmed their participation in the tournament,” explained Itaeli. Itaeli said the number of teams that expressed their interest in the tourney was a clear indication of how important grassroots level football is in churning out the talents of young children and the youth. “The number of teams speaks volume of how important the youth oriented annual soccer is,” he said. Some of the Tanzanian teams that will feature in this year’s edition include Azam, Mtibwa Sugar, Singida United, Ruaha Football Club of Iringa, Barrqs Sports Centre from Mwanza and JK-Symbion Academy from Dar.
