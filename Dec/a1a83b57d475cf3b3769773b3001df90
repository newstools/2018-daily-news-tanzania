SOME entrepreneurs in Nachingwea District, Lindi Region have said lack of permanent premises for production hinder efforts to access local and foreign markets. This was unveiled here yesterday during the awareness education seminar for entrepreneurs organised by Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS). “We do not have working premises to execute various activities and shortage of packaging materials hence fail to access and compete in the market,” said one of the entrepreneurs Zena Chiangu. She said most entrepreneurs in the district have little knowledge on procedures used to certify quality of products which hinder their efforts to access markets. Ms Chiangu said seminar has been an eye opener to understand procedures securing certificate of quality assurance from standard watchdog. However, she has already obtained an area for production and will soon start certification procedures. On his part, the TBS Head of Southern Zone, Haji Mussa urged SMEs to certify their products that would enable to access local and foreign markets. He said most goods produced by SMEs fall under the compulsory standards hence they ought to be certified before entering the markets. Mussa said the government recognizes the role played by SMEs in industrialisation drive hence it has been setting aside 100m/- every year to support them. According to him, the SMEs who intend to get the support have to channel their application through Small Industries Development Organisation (SIDO). “The organisation provides education to SMES, test quality of products and issues certificate free of charge,” he said.
