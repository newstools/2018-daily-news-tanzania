Principal Resident Magistrate Wilbard Mashauri imposed such sentence to the foreigners after convicting them on their own plea of guilty. The Magistrate further ordered that the two convicts be deported to their home country within 36 hours after imposing the sentence, while giving the task to the Immigration Department. "I came to the conclusion after having considered submissions from the prosecution based on how serious the offence is and that of the defence which claimed lenience to the accused as first offenders," alleged the Magistrate. Earlier on, while reading the facts of the case, Principal State Attorney Wankyo Simon alleged that the accused entered the country in 2017 for the purpose of working and doing various activities.

The two accused were claimed to be the employees of a company named Metro Steel Industry Ltd located at Kiwalani area in Ilala District, Dar es Salaam Region. According to the prosecutor throughout their employment, the accused did not possess working permits which therefore had no prerequisite qualifications to work in the country.
