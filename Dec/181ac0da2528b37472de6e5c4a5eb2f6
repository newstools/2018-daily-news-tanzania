President John Magufuli and his Kenyan counterpart, Uhuru Kenyatta have launched Namanga One-Stop Border Post (OSBP) in Namanga on Saturday afternoon (December 1, 2018). The dual have said that the post will facilitate and improve business environment between the two countries which are members of East African Community (EAC). During the launch, the Head of States directed the boarder officials to ensure petty traders are trading freely so long as they adhere to laws and regulations governing EAC. “We must open doors for these traders in this area to do their business without any blockages because they contribute highly in the economy growth of our countries,” he said. For his part, President Kenyatta said the East African Community (EAC) must create better grounds for trade within itself, otherwise poverty will persist. “After we have established our solid joint trade market, we can then have better investments from outside, and our people are the primary beneficiaries,” he added
