IN a bid to provide quality health services to majority of Tanzanians, the government is looking forward to begin construction of a district hospital in Kibiti, Coast Region this month. According to the District Medical Officer (DMO), Dr Martin Felician, already a total of 500m/- has been allocated for the purpose. Dr Felician told the ‘Daily News’ yesterday that in the first phase, three buildings are set to be built, including a pharmacy, Out Patient Department (OPD) and administration blocks. “We have received a sum of 500m/-, whereby 400m/- has been provided by the government and 100m/- has been offered by the Korean Health Foundation (KOFIH),” he revealed. Meanwhile, the projects for renovating and improving two health centres of Mbwera and Kibiti are going on well. At Mbwera Health Centre, the construction activities for a laboratory, maternity ward, staff house and toilets as well as installation of water system are going on. On the other hand, the district has managed to finish up the construction of a theater and mortuary while the labour ward is at the final stages at Kibiti Health Centre. The Paediatric ward at Kibiti Health Centre has been repaired and expanded and is now used as a maternity ward to curb congestion. “Apart from that, we have also managed to upgrade Mwambao dispensary to a health centre. The centre had only two wards, but now we have added four buildings, which are OPD, medical laboratory and a theatre,” he said.
