HEALTH stakeholders in the country have been urged to come up with practical resolutions on how to best invest in women’s health to reduce maternal mortality. Speaking during a twoday symposium on women’s health in sustainable development goals (SDGs) organised by Aga Khan Health Services and Aga Khan University (AKU) held in Dar es Salaam yesterday, Reproductive and Child Health Section in the Ministry of Health Community Development, Gender Elderly and Children Acting Assistant Director, Dr Ahmad Makuwani, said the symposium was a great step for Tanzania towards achieving SDGs, particularly in women’s health care across Tanzania. “We are working to ensure Tanzanian women have access to high quality and affordable health care on an equal basis. The government of Tanzania has continued improving the provision of women’s health care by increasing the number of health providers and nurses especially in rural areas,” Dr Makuwani said. Despite efforts from the government and health care providers, the government continued to see significant and heart-breaking day-today struggles and suffering. Women’s health must be integrated into a multisectoral approach based on gender and human rights approaches as the foundation of sustainable development for all nations. Aga Khan University’s Medical College Associate Dean, Dr Hussein Kidanto, emphasised that women’s health was the rule of all human action in society. He said the main aim of the symposium was to raise awareness on the state, place and value of women’s health in society. “Effective mobilisation, use of resources, the private sector, development partners and research institutions are crucial to the realisation of SDGs,” he noted. The event gathered health policy experts to discuss advancements in women’s health and explore challenges in gender and ethic disparities in health care in East Africa.
