COAST Regional Commissioner, Eng Evarist Ndikilo has said that the region will continue to set conditions to improve education standards in the region. Eng Ndikilo said in Kibaha Town yesterday that the fact that the region has emerged 11th in this year's Standard Seven National examinations from 19th position attained last year is a clear indication that the efforts are bearing fruits. The RC was speaking to the Regional Standard Seven Selection Committee in a meeting which was also attended by District Commissioners and District Executive Directors (DEDs). "We can do even better if we join our forces and solve the challenges which are obstructing us from performing better,” he told the membership of the Committee. He took time to urge all regional leaders from grassroots level to make sure pupils in every school are attending classes as required. “One of the problems we are facing in this region is school dropout cases through truancy and school pregnancy. I urge all leaders from grassroots level to work together on this matter and deal with those who impregnate schoolgirls and those who cause pupils to fail attending school accordingly,” he emphasised. According to the Regional Administrative Secretary, Ms Theresia Mbando, a total of 18,439 pupils have been selected to join secondary schools in 2019 in the region, whereby 8,835 are boys and 9,604 girls.
