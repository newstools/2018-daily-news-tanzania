PRIME Minister Kassim Majaliwa has directed ministers to evaluate the ability and competence of contractors assigned the duty of constructing offices of various ministries at Ihumwa area in Dodoma City. The Prime Minister issued the directive yesterday at Ihumwa area where the government has allocated a vast piece of land for the construction of the government city. During the site meeting, the premier held talks with 15 ministers, deputy ministers and permanent secretaries. The Prime Minister also directed each ministerial leadership to visit the respective sites for scrutiny to establish if the contractors assigned to construct the office buildings had the ability and competence to do the job in the set time frame. He ordered the ministers to change the contractors and engage new ones if it would be established beyond reasonable doubts that the current contractors have no ability and competence to do the job. “I direct you to sit with the contractors here at the site so that they (contractors) can tell you when they are going to complete the projects. Our goal is to ensure the job is completed on time,” the Prime Minister insisted. The PM used the occasion to share with ministers the challenges he noted when he toured each site for the construction of the office of each ministry on Thursday. Giving an example, the prime minister asked ministries whose buildings were being constructed by a contractor he mentioned as Mzinga to evaluate their ability and competence of handling the job and change him if it will be noted that he can’t finish the project on time. He directed contractors to bring more casual labourers to the site to speed up the project implementation, expressing his satisfaction with the pace of construction of the office for the Ministry of State in President’s Office (Public Service Management and Good Governance).
