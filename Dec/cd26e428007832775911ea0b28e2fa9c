AZAM FC striker Zambian Obrey Chirwa is set to make his Mainland Premier League debut in Azam colours today when they play against Mtibwa Sugar at Manungu Stadium in Morogoro. Chirwa joined Azam during the mini-transfer window as a free player from the Egyptian side Nogoom and has since managed to link up with his former striking partner Zimbabwean Donald Ngoma. Both Chirwa and Ngoma had memorable time at Young Africans before the duo parted ways with the club at different periods. Also, the two players have been re-united with their former coaches Hans Van Pluijn and Juma Mwambusi who previously offered their coaching tactics at the Jangwani based club before they crossed the line to the other side of the coin. Chirwa had a big impact on Sunday when Azam hosted Madini FC from Arusha at Azam Complex in the city during their Azam Sports Federation Cup (ASFC) clash as he provided an assist for the first goal of the match which ended 2-0 in favour of the hosts. Speaking through a telephone interview yesterday, Azam FC Communications Officer Jaffari Idd said the team landed safely in Morogoro ready for today’s battle. “So far, we have no injury concerns as each player is in good form ahead of tomorrow’s (today) game. We want to continue our unbeaten run of the season and with the new signings we made during the short transfer window, our strength has doubled,” Idd said. He added: “We do not underrate our opponents since they are also a good team who represented the country in the CAF Confederations Cup even though they have been eliminated from the competition.” Furthermore, Idd revealed that Frank Domayo who underwent for a knee surgery in South Africa is back and responding well to light training sessions such that any moment soon, he would be cleared to start playing competitively. Azam last won the Mainland Premier League title in the 2013-14 seasons where they clinched the trophy without losing any game and it was one of their greatest moments as the club.
