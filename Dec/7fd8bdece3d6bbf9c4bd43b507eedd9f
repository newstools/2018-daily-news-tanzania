A TOTAL of 336 families have been rendered homeless and one person killed after heavy rain accompanied by strong winds swept across Kipeta and Kilyamatundu villages along Lake Rukwa Basin in Rukwa Region. The dead person has been identified as Elizabeth Manamba (85) from Kipeta Village. According to eye witnesses, the old woman was killed after the wall of her house collapsed and fell on her. Other 50 people have been seriously injured and admitted to Kilyamatundu Health Centre. The rain also caused massive damage to five classrooms, two dormitories, staff houses, toilets and teachers’ offices. Regional Police Commander (RPC) George Kyando confirmed the incident, saying the two villages were mostly affected. He noted that the villagers had decided to seek refuge at neighbouring villages. Ms Neema Nyondo, a nurse at Kilyamatundu Health Centre, who was on duty on that day, said at least 36 victims, who sustained injuries, were taken to the health centre. She said the majority of them experienced arm, leg and head injuries. Sumbawanga District Council Chairman Kalolo Ntila, who visited the villages, said the actual loss caused by the heavy rain was yet to be determined although hundreds of acres of farms planted with maize and rice had been destroyed. He said the villagers had lost everything, including food and clothes. “We ask members of the public to support them wherever it is possible, they have lost everything.”
