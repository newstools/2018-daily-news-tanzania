THE Filbert Bayi Youth Handball championship which was scheduled to start in Zanzibar today has been postponed. The organisers said they were forced to postpone it as most players who were to take part in the tournament are students who are currently engaging in the National Form Two examinations. The tournament’s spokesman, Kombo Ali Kombo said the tournament will be held in early January next year. However, he didn’t mention the official date, but promised to make it public after the end of the examinations. “Normally this tournament is staged at the end of the year after the students complete doing their exams. Therefore, when they finish doing it we will be able to officially announce the new date,” said the spokesman. Adding, Kombo noted that the tournament was also expected to provide a platform for students who had completed their secondary school education from 2015 to 2017. The tournament is organised and backed by Filbert Bayi Foundation with an aim to search talented youths from various secondary schools countrywide. In his remarks Kombo said handball which was popular in the country from 1970s to late 1990s lost its ground in the later years.
