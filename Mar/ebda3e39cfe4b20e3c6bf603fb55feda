This year’s International Women’s Day theme states, “Time is Now: Rural and urban activists transforming women’s lives.” Ms Mwalimu said that in recognition of gender-based issues and contribution of women in the country’s development, the government has rectified various international protocols and agreements that aim at supporting women. She added that the fifth government has been improving environment for women including those in rural areas for inclusive economic development. According to Ms Mwalimu, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has listed Tanzania top in inclusive economy among African countries in 2018. Inclusive growth is economic development that creates opportunity for all segments of the population and distributes the dividends of increased prosperity, both in monetary and non-monetary terms, fairly across society. The report also indicated how Tanzania considers gender-based issues in building up the economy.

They commented that ahead of celebrations of Women’s Day today, there is need for women across the world to fight violence and ensure welfare is guaranteed.

It is no surprise, therefore, that it is widely under-reported and regarded as an accepted norm,” reads part of the statement. Joseph Mbasha, Programme Manager for Rights at HelpAge in the country , said that there is an urgent need for the government to speed up the implementation of the national strategy to combat older people’s killings, as well as the enactment of older people’s law, which will be key in addressing the social ills that older people, particularly older women, are subjected to, in our communities. “Violence, abuse and neglect against older women do not only happen behind closed doors. It happens on public transport, in hospitals and in shops and markets where they are often ignored and insulted,” he said.
