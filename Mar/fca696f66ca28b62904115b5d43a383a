The training were run by Feed the Future Tanzania Enabling Growth through Investment and Enterprise (ENGINE) Programme supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). It is projected that the advisors will be able to guide business owners through a structured, step-by-step process that includes an assessment of the business, a discussion of their financial goals and working together to improve record keeping and financial planning to make the business more attractive loan candidate to financial institutions. Businesses that complete the process are then linked to a network of financial institutions. “This service offers small businesses in Tanzania a clear path to improving their chances of qualifying for a loan and a way to connect with financial institutions positioned to meet their needs,” said Scott Bennett, Deputy Chief of Party for the ENGINE Programme. “The training has helped me realize that there is a big gap between small businesses and financial institutions. With the knowledge gained from the ENGINE training, I will be able to help my clients develop a sound and attractive business plan that will definitely give them a chance to obtain business loans from lenders,” said Anganile Mwakaba of the Mbeya based Desk Tech Company Limited.
