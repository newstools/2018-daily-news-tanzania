The seven people who were travelling in the black mini-SUV escaped with minor injuries, despite the badly mangled car shell which was lying on its back by the time we arrived at the scene. The seven occupants happened to be members of the Moshi Veteran team, which was travelling to Arusha to participate in the ‘Kitambi Noma’ Easter Bonanza. The sporting and entertainment event was supposed to be held here for two days, on Saturday and Sunday. In another accident, a small car with registration numbers T414 DLC which was travelling from Tunduma going towards Arusha, rammed into a head of cattle in Mtera area of Dodoma, becoming a write-off. Coincidentally again, all the four passengers in the ill-fated car were travelling to Arusha to participate in the ‘Kitambi Noma’ Easter Bonanza. They, however, escaped death with minor injuries but are definitely going to miss the weekend bonanza which starts here this Saturday and closing on Sunday. The two accidents featuring one car from the North and another from South, occurred almost around the same time, Friday noon, with both cars and their respective travellers heading to participate in the single Easter Bonanza of Arusha. By the time we went to press, authorities, as well as organisers of the ‘Kitambi Noma,’ weekend bash, were yet to release official statement regarding the issue. Meanwhile, members of Christendom Denominations in Arusha Region gathered for communal joint open air mass at the Sheikh Amri Abeid Stadium on Friday morning, a worship and Christ’s Death on the Cross reminiscence mass. Later, all churches whose members were mostly clad in black clothes, gathered for follow- up afternoon masses at their respective religious houses across the region.
