According to a press statement issued yesterday by the Permanent Secretary (PS) in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation, Prof Adolf Mkenda, Prof Mahalu has regained his former status as from yesterday. Prof Mkenda noted that in 2012 the court issued a ruling which acquitted Prof Mahalu from the charges. “As per the Public Service procedures, any person who at one point served as an ambassador will retain the title throughout the entire life regardless of retirement,” noted the PS. He observed that due to the President’s decision, from now onwards Prof Mahalu will hold his status as an Ambassador.
