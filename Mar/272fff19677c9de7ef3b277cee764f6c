The Director of KIWOHEDE, Ms Justa Mwaituka, exclusively informed the ‘Daily News’ that the inclusive training aimed at rescuing girls from consequences emanating from forced marriages and unwanted pregnancies started early in February, 2017, involving Institute of Adult Education and Commonwealth of Learning from Canada. Ms Mwaituka underscored the need to involve community leaders, parents, respective district authorities, faith-based organisations and ward leadership as a strategy to facilitate implementation of the project. Some skills provided by KIWOHEDE include tailoring, weaving, embroidery, cookery, aimed at generating income to beneficiaries. “Previous studies conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and other organisations revealed that girls in Ruangwa and Kilwa districts were victims of forced marriages that also caused school dropouts,” Ms Justa noted. She further said that the area covered include four wards with the aim to reach out 1,200 girls in both districts, adding that creation of awareness was the main target which should be attained through involvement of parents, caretakers and the community at large
