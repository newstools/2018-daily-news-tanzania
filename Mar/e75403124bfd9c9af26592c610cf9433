Kagera Regional TRA Manager, Mr Adam Ntoga told reporters that several suspects have been nabbed and will be arraigned in court to answer charges of posing as TRA officials and obtaining money by false pretenses. “People should be careful when they are approached by people who do not possess TRA identity cards. They should use their mobile phones to picture the culprits and report the matter to a nearest police station. He said taxpayers should also be careful and avoid giving money to the conmen as inducement to have reduction on their tax payments, saying that all tax related matters are conducted in TRA offices and all TRA staff have genuine identity cards. Meanwhile, two people were today morning arraigned before the Muleba Resident Magistrate, Benedict Nkomola, to answer various charges, including posing as TRA officials and obtaining money by false pretenses, including armed robbery. Prosecuting, Police Sergeant Charles Mpelwa named the accused as Bushako Kawawa (29) and Abdul Kawawa (26), both residents of Kagabiro village in Muleba district. He told the court that on March 16, this year, the accused unlawfully presented themselves as TRA officers to a businessman, Gration Shadrack, and obtained various goods worth 212,000/- by false pretenses. Again on March 19, this year the accused approached Charles Kamuhanda, another businessman and identified themselves as TRA officials and obtained goods worth 128,000/- by false pretenses. According to Sergeant Mpelwa, the accused used weapons to obtain the goods. “Your honour, the accused are facing a serious charge of armed robbery. Granting them bail at this moment will be detrimental to the investigating machinery,” he argued. Magistrate Nkomola agreed with the prosecutor and ordered the accused to be remanded in custody until April 13, this year when the case will be mentioned again.
