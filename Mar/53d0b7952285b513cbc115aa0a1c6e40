Barclays Bank Tanzania Citizenship Manager, Hellen Siria, said in Dar es Salaam that the Elevate programme is an award-winning international education company which has been training students to use the best-practice study skills for the last 16 years. “Elevate equips students with skills they need to succeed in school and beyond. It also trains teachers and parents/ guardians to ensure bestpractice study behaviours are reinforced across the classroom and at home,” she said. She added, “The Elevate programme works with more than 2,500 schools and 500,000 students each year and here in UDSM we are targeting 24 students,” Ms Siria said they use three steps in identifying students including an online audit of students, use of independent learning skills and student engagements which guarantee a high level of engagement to maximize skill uptake and challenge negative perceptions of study skills. The elevate programme will help students increase self-efficacy which fosters independent learning, increase student efficiency, motivation levels across the year, improve the caliber of student graduating from university and in addition will achieve a sustained behaviour shift in students study habits and equip students with essential academic and non-academic skills that can assist with tertiary education and the transition into the work place. “Our aim is to change learning behaviour and inspire students to achieve their goals which for many would lead in breaking the poverty cycle”. She continued “The elevate programme will improve academic performances of students and it will also help offer employments to students to deliver the programme for a second year.” The Elevate programme is currently working with 150 South African schools and 25 universities with scholarships in African countries. In addition, the Elevate programme has conducted workshops to more than 25,000 students and presented three conferences for over 100 teachers across South Africa
