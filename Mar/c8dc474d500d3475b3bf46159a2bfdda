The public awareness campaigns have been held over the past one year by an NGO dealing with legal aid, gender, children and human rights issues in Kilimanjaro region – the Kilimanjaro Women Information Exchange and Community Organisation (KWIECO). KWIECO Managing Director, Ms Elizabeth Minde revealed this during the organisation’s Annual General Meeting held here over the weekend, saying the number had ‘beaten’ their own target of serving 15,000 people. In a statement read on her behalf by Ms Elizabeth Mushi, MD Minde said the education provided was part of the five-year strategic plan of the organisation. “… through this programme we reached 405 clients … who received legal assistance from KWIECO lawyers; this number is way above our earlier target of serving 350 clients … a 116 per cent increase,” she noted. Ms Minde also said another 9,795 clients were given legal advice that she said was equivalent to 97.95 per cent of its targeted 10,000 clients. However, Ms Minde said her NGO was facing shortage of funds to run the Centre which was initially established to provide temporary shelter to victims of violence.
