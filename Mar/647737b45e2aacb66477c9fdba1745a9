The annual awards, created by leading industry publication International Transport News, recognized excellence amongst all role players in the global aviation industry. “It is a tremendous honour to receive recognition by such prestigious awards from within our industry,” said fastjet Chief Executive Officer Nico Bezuidenhout. “It also serves as a validation for the substantial changes and significant enhancements made during the Stabilisation Plan which included a full network reengineering process, a complete fleet changeover, a new reservation system launch and market entry of the fastjet brand into Mozambique along with a move from London to African soil, amongst others.” He added, more than anything, awards recognize the efforts of employees at fastjet whose relentless pursuit of excellence has been evident with the airline’s network wide on-time performance exceeding 90 per cent for the second month in a row that is January 91 per cent and February 94 per cent. The award is fastjet’s third accolade in as many quarters following the Skytrax World Airline Awards’ Best Low-Cost Airline in Africa and the World Travel Awards’ Leading African Low- Cost Carrier honours received in 2017.
