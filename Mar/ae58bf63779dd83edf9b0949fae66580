The Dodoma Municipal Director, Mr Godwin Kunambi, told a council meeting here on Tuesday that the Council would acquire the funds from its internal sources, central government and donors. He pointed out the new strategies to improve sources of revenues for the municipal council seek to come up with new mega-projects through the Public and Private Partnership (PPP) and assessment of outstanding debts to repay the fund. Mr Kunambi said that the Municipal Council would also set up a database of all new plots in the municipality in order to monitor its revenues collection in the land sector, adding that the database would help the council to get actual figure of revenues. The Council’s Economy Officer, Mr Shaaban Juma, said the revenue collection had gone up to over 120bn/- during FY 2018/2019, up from a lowly 75.7bn/- in FY 2017/2018 which was equivalent to 70 per cent growth. He noted that the municipal council would acquire 52 per cent of its budget from its internal source and 47 per cent from the central government. “The revenues collection increase is the result of improvement of statistics of tax payers largely in land sector which includes land survey and plots and business tax,” he added. Earlier while opening the council meeting, the Dodoma Municipal Mayor, Prof Davis Mwamfupe, said the budget should meet demand of the people, saying the council members should consider the status of capital city while passing the budget. “Council members should consider first the status of capital city rather than projects to be executed in your respective areas,” he said.
