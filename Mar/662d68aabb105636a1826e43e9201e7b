The RC issued the directive here at a recent regional consultative council (RCC) meeting, saying instead of relocating the executives to other districts they should be educated to address the problem themselves. He explained that relocations weren’t an ideal way to address such laxity, and that such moves only served to create problems at new areas to which lazy officers may have been relocated. Dr Mahenge was responding to concerns raised over underperforming executives in Mpwapwa District, from which some RCC members had suggested the relocation of the executives to other districts within Dodoma region. Earlier, Mpwapwa District Commissioner (DC) Jabir Shekimweri, said his district had been underperforming in revenue collection, attributing the problem to executives who do not perform their duties diligently. Mpwapwa District Council Chairman, Mr Donat Ng’hwenzi, also accused some (unnamed) executives were cheating the authorities on revenue collections, citing an example that revenue collections could be as high as 26m/- but executives often deposited just 26,000/- into the council’s Bank account. He explained that Mpwapwa District had lucrative sources of revenue, including the Mtera Dam which benefits both Mpwapwa and Chamwino districts. But he said Chamwino was far ahead of Mpwapwa in revenue collection, even though the two districts share in revenues accrued from the Mtera Dam. Chamwino District Council Chairman Samuel Kaweya said his council previously collected ‘very little’ income, but then moved quickly to closely monitor its executives responsible for revenue collection. “Revenue collections have now increased more than tenfold … from a mere three million to 35m/- … this was after we started monitoring …. very closely …. the executives responsible for the revenue collections,” he said.
