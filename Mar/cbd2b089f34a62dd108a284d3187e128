Mr Wasonga, a partner with National Attorneys, addressing reporters here yesterday, promised major reforms in the bar association, saying TLS will become economically self reliant under his one-year administration. “I plan to initiate many projects, which will generate earnings for the society to become self-reliant economically,” said the advocate. He said under his administration, TLS will resume its duties to provide the government with legal support largely in international arena, saying one of the goals for its establishment was to support the government. “TLS should be on the frontline to advocate for the government to acquire our aircraft impounded in Canada,” he observed. Mr Wasonga said his administration will request the Controller and Auditor General (CAG) to audit TLS, which he said owns properties. Apart from Mr Wasonga, other advocates who have already declared their candidature for the top post within TLS are Ms Fatma Karume, Mr Godwin Ngwilimi and Mr Godwin Mwapongo.
