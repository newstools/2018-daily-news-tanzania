The call was made here by the Minister for Work, Empowerment, Women, Elders and Children, Ms Mauldine Castico when gracing women’s special gala, ‘Queen’s Night’, organized by CRDB Zanzibar Branch, as part of the ongoing International Women’s Day celebrations. The minister said that saving is a sure way of liberating women from dependency and implored them to develop the culture and set up good plans and goals for their lives. She encouraged them to work with banks, insisting that through saving up money, they can have enough finances to meet their family expenditures. “Women are supposed to learn financial discipline and embrace the culture of saving as a way of uplifting the welfare of their families,” the minister said, and called upon them to avoid extravagant and unconscionable expenditures. Ms Castico told the Isles women that they should plan well how to use personal finances before embarking on any expenditure and advised them to utilise CRDB’s Malkia Account, a unique saving plan that is designed for women who wish to meet their financial obligations as well as personal goals and dreams by investing monthly. She urged women to wake up and engage themselves in various economic activities and avoid staying jobless, noting that they can only fight poverty, which affects majority of women, through hard working. The minister commended the bank for supporting women’s causes and ensuring that they’re given equal rights and opportunities. Speaking earlier, CRDB Zanzibar Branch Manager, Eusebio Mubofu offered details on the Malkia account, saying it aimed at empowering women so that they meet their personal dreams. “This account is meant for all women who are either employed, self-employed, entrepreneurs with stable or permanent source of income, they can open the account and enjoy the benefits that come with this account,” he said. “By empowering woman you empower the entire society, that’s why we decided to come up with this special account for women,” he added.
