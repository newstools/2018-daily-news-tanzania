That was unveiled at a meeting that brought together heads of departments from the council to unlock resources in the council which is located near Tarangire national park and Lake Manyara. Apart from tourism industry, the council is also targeting to boost revenue from agriculture and forest. A Senior Lecturer with MoCU, Mr Mangasin Katundu said that local people could as well invest in zoos and the council should attract businesspersons to invest in hotels, create employment, boost their income and revenue to the council. The district council has already worked with researchers from the university to identify different opportunities for investment in the district that, if well promoted would increase sources of income. Mr Katundu said that Babati has vast investment opportunities for locals and foreigners and could soon contribute to industrialisation drive. “The agricultural sector is wide and open to many as there are many areas that investment could be done. Babati also has tourism attractions, forest reserves so there is no reason why huge investment is not done,” said the don. Babati District Council Chairman, Mr Mohamed Kibiki said they decided to engage with MoCU in identifying sources of funds due to the council being in bad economic situation.
