A video clip has circulated in social media, depicting people forcing to enter a building, which is purported to be the Tanzanian Embassy offices in Oman. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation said in a statement in Dar es Salaam last evening that as opposed to the rumours, the Tanzanians had wanted to force themselves into Golden Tulip Hotel in Muscat for a scheduled meeting but the venue was filled beyond capacity. “After discussions with our embassy in Oman, we learned that it had arranged the meeting for Tanzanians on March 23, this year, at Golden Tulip Hotel in Muscat, Oman. Announcements were made for people to register prior to the gathering. “About 200 Tanzanians registered for the event and the embassy made arrangements for food and drinks to host 300 people at the venue. However, over 1,000 people turned up beyond the capacity of the facility,” the statement read in part. After realising the huge turn-out, the organising committee decided to close the doors and asked those outside to return home but they insisted on entering, leading to the chaos, the ministry explained. “It was at this juncture that the video clip was captured... the organising committee which included Tanzanians living in Oman decided to postpone the meeting in favour of proper arrangements for more people,” the statement elaborated. The ministry allayed fears that Tanzanians had thronged the embassy building, demanding their return home.
