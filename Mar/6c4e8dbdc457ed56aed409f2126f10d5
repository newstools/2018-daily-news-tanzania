Makori made the call on Thursday in his speech to mark the climax of the World Water week in the city. This year’s theme was ‘Water Ecosystem and Human Development’, where the event was marked at Mburahati Barafu grounds in Dar es Salaam Region. The DC advised Dar residents to put up with this year’s theme of ‘Water ecosystem and human development,’ as it reminds every one of the vital responsibility of preserving environment and water sources in order to have sustainable water sources as well as increase water production in the region. At least 75 per cent of Dar es Salaam residents access safe and clean water. However, the government target is to supply water to 95 per cent of ‘wananchi’ in the city. Moreover, the DC said the government is also doing everything in its powers to ensure water pipes and water drainage systems are well fixed to ensure reliable supply of water to the residents.
