The contract was signed between the TAA Acting Director General, Richard Mayongela and Felix Maagi, NHC Acting Director General, with the Deputy Minister for Works, Transport and Communication, Atashasta Nditiye presiding over as a witness in the city. Mr Mayongela said the expansion was paramount taking into consideration the increase in number of passengers now travelling into the Capital City. He said the expansion work is expected to take three months till completion, adding that the current two lounges with a capacity to accommodate 35 seated passengers will then be upgraded to handle more than 140 people. “The construction will start early next month and the duration will be three months, we hope, the contractors, the NHC will finish the project within the time of the money value in stipulation,” he added. Speaking during the event, Mr Maagi assured TAA that NHC will showcase why they are the best contractors with high quality workmanship, without disrupting routine activities in the lounges of the passengers. He also assured them that ‘the value of their money’ and work will be finished on the agreed timeframe, adding that TAA inspectors are invited any time and payments made on time for them to meet the deadline. “We will give you the best and this is a litmus test for us, let me assure you that we will do our best, as the project is an entry point for us to be awarded other projects,” said NHC Acting Director General. On his part, the Deputy Minister, urged NHC to work around the clock and if possible complete the work in less than three months’ time. “I know you can, with the kind of workforce and equipment you have…I am sure, you can complete the expansion project in less than three months’ time,” pointed out Nditiy
