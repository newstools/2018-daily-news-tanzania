The construction of the dispensary in the area will help residents of the said ward to enjoy health services nearby. Construction of the dispensary is funded by the African Relief Organisation. Mr Majaliwa said that President John Magufuli’s plan is to strengthen the health sector by building and upgrading medical facilities to ensure many people have access to healthcare services closer to their homes. Earlier, Mbecha Village Executive Officer, Mr Alfan Ngaeje said the idea of constructing the village dispensary began in 1987, but it was stopped due to poor economic conditions facing its residents. He said they continued to have difficulties in accessing health services especially for pregnant women and children who were walking long distances to other villages’ dispensaries. Mr Ngaeje said the service that will be offered in the dispensary include Out Patient Department (OPD), maternity and children’s clinic, immunisation and family planning.
