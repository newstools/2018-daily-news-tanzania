Speaking during FOCAC Alignment Workshop here yesterday, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Policy Advisor, Mr Laurence Mbwambo said there are a number of opportunities and investment avenues in environment , gas and oil and other related sectors which can be tapped during the September forum in Johannesburg in South Africa. “That is why we have decided to host almost 15 CSOs here for action plan and priority setting on areas of interest for submission to the required bodies, which will table them during the forum,” he said He said the CSOs were brought together to brainstorm and come up with issues to be submitted for discussion to the government and ultimately ensure that the country benefits from the forum. Mr Mbwambo said they believe CSO who work closely with the public will be in a better position to know the needs and areas of interest as per investment and resource needed. “We equip them with the knowledge on the issues for discussion at such forums to enable them come up with plans that match the available opportunities,” said Mr Mbwambo. Chairman of the Northern Coalition for Extractives and Environment (NEEC) Josiah Severre said the level of understanding of opportunities availed in such forums remains low and called for more public involvement. “If our people will not be aware of the opportunities available, then, we might be lagging behind as other countries tap them fully...involvement and education to our people are of paramount importance” said Mr Severre Managing Director of Environment Media Agenda Sechelela Balisidya insisted on the government to set its areas of priorities by involving all concerned parties to attain its goals. “We as CSOs know what we want and the government can have an audience with all its partners so that we move together as a nation and benefit, considering that not only us are seeking the opportunities” she said
