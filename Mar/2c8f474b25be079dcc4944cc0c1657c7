The UN Aids agency UNAIDs released a roadmap for ending the AIDS pandemic suggesting 90 per cent of all people living with HIV should know their HIV status, 90 per cent of people diagnosed with HIV receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) and 90 percent of all people on HIV treatment achieve viral suppression to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030. With just twelve years to the benchmark, Tacaids Executive Director Mr Leonard Maboko said 91 per cent of people living with HIV in the country know their status. “Nearly 88 per cent of them receive ART … unfortunately we still have more work on viral suppression that is still at 52 per cent,” he said. He said no one will be left behind in the battle …“if at all we need to win.” The anti-AIDs body said the pandemic was a cross-cutting issue in the country which needs a collective approach -- not to be left to the Ministry of Health or (even) Tacaids. He was speaking at a meeting in Dodoma bringing legal officers, representatives of civil society organisations, policy-makers, and the judiciary to deliberate the legal paradox slowing HIV prevention measures. Mr Maboko said the meeting was part of a comprehensive strategy by the Commission to review shortfalls in the policy and legal framework that might be affecting HIV prevention actions in both Tanzania Mainland and the Isles. “We want the existing policy, strategy and legal commitments to promote best environment for HIV prevention among all groups,” he said. Tacaids Director for Monitoring and Evaluation Dr Jerome Kamwela said the current official figures estimate that Tanzania has 1.4million people living with HIV.
