That was revealed by some of the elders who explained openly the abuses they experience when they go to seek health services, and among the victims is a retired doctor. Speaking at a meeting of the district elders who included retired officers based in Hai district of Kilimanjaro region, a retired doctor, Dr Raymond Mboya explained the negative response he was subjected to by one of the attendants (name withheld) at the Hai District Hospital. “These dirty language complaints lodged by some of my colleagues here are true … if severe measures are not taken by the authorities, then we old people who seek health services will continue to be harassed by unethical health attendants,” he said. Dr Mboya said that he had taken his mother to the Hai District Hospital for treatment and one of the attendants there told him straight away that if he did not have money he should send his mother to a private hospital. He added that when he asked whether the government health announcement concerning the aged involved also private hospitals, the answers he received from one of the attendants at the hospital were shocking. “The attendant told me that they knew nothing about free treatment for elders at the hospital … I did not want to argue …. instead I took my mother with me and left,” said Dr Mboya.
