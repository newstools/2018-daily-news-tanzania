The DC also encouraged other stakeholders, including religious organisations to chip in and replicate the method to further the government’s initiative and help more people living in abject poverty to sustain their lives. Mr Ntarambe made the call during a visit by some members from the media in Chato district to foresee implementation of TASAF programmes over the week. He pointed out that the longing has gone up simply because it is clear that people are witnessing their fellows excelling through the programme. According to him, the TASAF mode is a result oriented, and this can be observed directly from the best practices of the beneficiaries, therefore, if other stakeholders can replicate the system the 100 per cent target will be realised. He further observed that the programme can be extended to a revolving fund for households which will be phased out and new ones enrolled. The Council Chairman, Mr Batholomeo Manuga noted that out of 115 villages found in the districts, 71 villages have been enrolled into the programme and the remaining 44 villages have not. Through TASAF, he said that the district was able to collect over 70m/- as contributions in Community Health Fund (CHF) for the year 2016-2017, and in the previous year to date already over 60m/- has been collected. Such achievements are observed because of TASAF beneficiaries joining CHF have encouraged more citizens to seek the service. “The beneficiaries are using part of their cash transfer to pay an amount of 10,000/- for their whole families to access medical care at health centres,” pointed out Mr Manuga.
