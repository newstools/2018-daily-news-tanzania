The Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) Regional Manager, Mr Joseph Mtandika urged people to always get receipts upon procurement of goods and services. Mr Mtandika said failure to issue receipts leads to sellers not setting proper records of their sales, hence evading taxes to the government. He said many people in the region are not abiding to the law as they buy goods and services without claiming proper receipts. He said that TRA has been campaigning and urging businesspersons to acquire the Electronic Fiscal Device (EFD) machines to ease ways to issue receipts, but there are some who are not complying. “We are facing a challenge in people not claiming receipts upon procurement of goods and services. They are bound to have them, and ensure they are correct ones in regard to goods and services they procure. Some procure items worth 300,000/- but are contented with being issued with a receipt with less the amount,” said Mr Mtandika. He said that if one does not demand and get a receipt they could be penalised, citing the amount ranging from 30,000/- to 150m/-, while for traders they could end up paying up to 4.5m/- or be jailed.
