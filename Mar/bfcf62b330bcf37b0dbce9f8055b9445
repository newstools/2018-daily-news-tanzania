MUM Kigamboni campus is aimed at generating many experts in business management, who will meet the labour market requirements in the East Africa Community (EAC) and Southern African Development Community (SADC). This was revealed recently by MUM Vice-Chancellor, Professor Hamza Njozi, while laying a foundation stone where the campus will be built in Lingata area, Kisarawe II Ward, Kigamboni Municipality. “This college shall be unique; we will use lecturers from around the World who will be teaching through modules. We want students who graduate from the college to compete well in the labour market,” said Prof Njozi. He said the Kigamboni campus is expected to increase enrolment of local and international students. Expounding further, he said last year during the 10th graduation, 5,433 students were conferred with degrees, diploma and certificates; currently, the university has more than 3,000 students and has a capacity of taking 8,000. According to VC, the construction will cost 47bn/- until completion and once it’s complete, it will be equipped with necessary infrastructure to accommodate all students. “We are on course to find a contractor for the completion of the initial preparation procedures, before starting the construction of the campus,” he said. He added that, for now, the university provides training for its graduates to afford working anywhere including considering self-employment rather than relying on employment alone. President of MUM Students Organisation, Yahya Khamis, said the university was implementing the fifth phase policy that focuses on industrialisation. “I request the government to support the construction of this campus for it to succeed,” he noted
