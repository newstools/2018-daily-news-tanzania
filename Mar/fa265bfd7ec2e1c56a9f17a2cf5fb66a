Dodoma Regional Police Commander (RPC) Gilles Muroto, told a press conference here yesterday that the two suspects had shared messages, which incite hatred against the government, through social media networks. Mr Muroto mentioned the suspects as Amandus Manchali (31) who is a driver with the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) and a paddy farmer, Yuda Mbata (29) of Mpamatwa Village in Bahi District. “While Manchali, who is a public servant, is a resident of Kigamboni in Dar es Salaam was on official duty here, Mbata is a paddy farmer in Bahi District” he observed. Mr Muroto said the demonstration was banned due to its goals to be based on hatred against the government. He said that it was illegal to stage demonstration with the intention of violating peace. “Members of the public should make use of the social media networks for speeding up development instead of fomenting peace violation,” he said. Meanwhile, the RPC, noted that three family members died on March 18 when a house wall fell on them at Gwandi Village in Chemba District due to ongoing heavy rains in Dodoma. He mentioned the names of the deceased as Misa James (25), Happy James (2) and Mbalu James (whose age was not immediately known) who were asleep when they met death at around 10:00 pm. Mr Muroto pointed out that the deceased’s bodies were taken to Dodoma Regional Referral Hospital for preservation pending burial arrangements
