Deputy Minister for Works, Transport and Communications, Mr Elias Kwandikwa, made the revelation here on Thursday, directing TBA regional office to construct the houses, which will become model to other regions. “The new houses should be a reflection of the capital city where others can come andemulate you,” the Deputy Minister said here while addressing staff members from TBA and Tanzania Electrical and Services Agency (TAMESA), both agencies are under his portfolio. The new housing units will bring to a total number of 1,389 housing units built by TBA in Dodoma from the current 889 houses, hence to curb the problem of accommodation to civil servants moving to the Central Zone Region. Mr Kwandikwa said TBA should also come up with a new strategy to maintain the housing units, pointing out that it should set aside timeframe for repairing those rented by public servants. “TBA should also come up with a programme to conduct assessment of their assets after at least every ten years,” he added. The acting TBA Dodoma Regional Manager, Mr Steven Simba, said some tenants have a tendency of delaying paying rent, thus posing a challenge to TBA operations, urging the Deputy Minister to help in addressing the problem. “Paying rent on time will help us run our activities smoothly and facilitate the government’s goal to shift to Dodoma,” said Mr Simba. He pointed out that TBA had played a key role in the government’s goal to relocate from Dar es Salaam to Dodoma by providing accommodation to civil servants and buildings for government offices.
