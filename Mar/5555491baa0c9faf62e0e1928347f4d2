Speaking at the African Insurance exhibition taking place at Mlimani City grounds in Dar es salaam, Sam Kamanga, a chairman for Association Tanzania Insurers said that new entrants of the Tanzania job market were born post 1990s, hence technology especially smart phone, is more important tool to them and can not be considered to be luxury good "The future is now! Drones are now used to supply some form of medicines to remote areas in this same African continent, so insurers must adapt to technology or else they remain museums" said Kamanga. He further advised insurance service provider to redesign their businesses to attract consumers attention for in this advanced technological era, people buy what they prefer and not necessarily what market offers. The event was officiated by Director of insurance Audit Elia Kajiba from Tanzania Insurance Regulatory Authority on behalf of the Authority's commissioner Dr. Baghayo Saqwere.
