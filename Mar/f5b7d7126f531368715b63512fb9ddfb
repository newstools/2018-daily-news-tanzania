The Kagera Regional TRA Manager, Adam Ntog'ha told the `Daily News' that revenue collection from July last year to February this year reached 28.772bn/- which is equivalent to 84.7 per cent of the target of 33.976bn/- He said the earthquake that struck some parts of the region in 2016 which destabilized some businesses had contributed to lower revenue collection in the first eight months of the financial year. An earthquake measuring 5.7 on the Richter scale struck on September 2016 in Kagera region killing at least 19 people and injuring over 500 people, the majority in and around the town of Bukoba or in Missenyi District to the north. Over 840 homes had been destroyed and another 2,000 damaged, leaving thousands of families homeless. The TRA Manager said lower revenue collection were also contributed by low coffee output due to drought that hit most parts of the region last year. "Coffee production declined due to drought," he said adding the region could not collect an estimated 240m/- from coffee sales from primary societies. According to him Karagwe market fire incident of last year had also contributed to low revenue collection as businesses were affected and could not pay taxes as expected. According to him they could not collect an estimated 170.7m/- from the market. Mr Ntog'ha said the region could not collect an estimated amount of 520m/- after research activities under Economic Development Initiative (EDI) declined. EDI is a survey research and consultancy house providing clients from the public, private and civil society sectors expert knowledge, skills and tools to improve their effectiveness to promote economic development in developing countries.

According to him, Mtukula border post accounts for 75 per cent of total customs revenue.
