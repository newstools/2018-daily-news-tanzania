The call was made by Coast Regional Commissioner (RC), Engineer Evarist Ndikilo during his inspection tour of water projects implemented by the Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority (DAWASA) in Coast Region. The RC said Ruvu River which was the major source of water for the two regions, producing 88 per cent of water utilized by Dar es Salaam and Coast regions, must be protected seriously. Due to the importance of the river to the two regions, Eng Ndikilo urged Bagamoyo and Kibaha District Commissioners and other government leaders to ensure the river is highly protected from destruction, by putting emphasis on the law that prohibits human activities, 60 metres from the river bank as well implementing other by laws as to ensure the river is preserved for sustainable water supply. “We promise Dawasa that Coast Region through Kibaha and Bagamoyo districts where the river crosses, will put emphasis in protecting the river in an effort to ensure the major source of water supply for Coast and Dar es Salaam regions, is sustainable and produce enough water,” he stressed. Apart from Ruvu , the two regions also depend on water supply from Kizinga River which contributes three percent where the remaining nine per cent comes from drilled boreholes. During the inspection tour Eng Ndikilo showed satisfaction on various projects under Dawasa which target to end water scarcity as well boost industrial investments in the region.
