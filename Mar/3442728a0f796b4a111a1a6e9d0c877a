Mr Mwijage who toured the factory said there were some countries that relied on small factories such as this one in Manyara for development and called upon more people to invest in the sub-sector. Last year, the factory produced 4,500 tonnes of sugar and now expects to roll out some 6,000 tonnes this year. Mr Mwijage said he appreciated the factory because it makes use of a small area for production. “There are countries that are highly competitive in sugar business but are using small areas … just as Manyara Sugar does and this is what we have to do,” said the minister, adding that the country was on the right track in its industrialisation drive. He called upon people to invest in the sector, even at small plots, grow sugarcane so that is used as raw material instead of leaving the whole country to rely on Kilombero and Kagera sugar industries. He said that the government has firmly controlled importation of sugar so as to ensure local industries thrive and curb inflation. He said that permits have been issued to import only 130,000 tonnesto supplement the needs. A senior official with the factory, Mr John Jeu said they are planning to produce electricity from the plant. However, he said they are faced with a challenge in deficiency of sugarcane and lack of awareness in sugarcane growing among the locals.
