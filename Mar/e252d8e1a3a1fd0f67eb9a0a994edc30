The Mbeya coal to power project comprises the development of the Mbeya Coal Mine, a 1.5Mt p/a mining operation and the Mbeya Power Plant, a 300 MW mine-mouth thermal power station. Fortnight ago, Tanesco signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Kibo as a precursor to the finalisation of a power purchase agreement (PPA) for the Mbeya coal-to-power project. The PPA is expected to be finalised as early as the end of the first quarter of this year, in accordance with the timelines previously agreed with Tanesco and the Tanzania Ministry of Energy. The MoU sets out clear guidelines, deliverables and timelines for the conclusion of the PPA, which will enable Aim- and JSE-listed Kibo to move towards the conclusion of the final development phase of the project which includes construction and commissioning.
