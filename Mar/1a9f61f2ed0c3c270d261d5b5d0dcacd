Kyerwa District Council Chairman, Mr Kashunju Runyogote, raised the concern during the Regional Roads Board meeting held in Bukoba Municipality chaired by the Kagera Regional Commissioner (RC), Major Gen (retired) Salum Kijuu. “Under the procurement of common use items and services, the agency is responsible for conducting inspection prior and after the service and shall issue a certificate of approval, with a fee being charged for such inspection. We are being unlawfully charged 80,000/- for inspection fees. This is day-light robbery,” he contended. Mr Runyogiote charged further that TEMESA services left a lot to be desired adding that most of the government vehicles which were serviced by the agency were nowgrounded citing as an example that the Council paid over 20m/- for servicing the official car used by Kyerwa District Commissioner (DC), Col Shaban Lissu, but the car was now grounded. TEMESA Deputy Regional Manager, Mr Charles Mbegele, argued that there was no foul play adding that the 80,000/- inspection fees was in line with directions from higher authorities and he had a document to that effect. Following a heated debate, Mr Kijuu ordered TEMESA official to ensure that he brings a copy of the letter to his office tomorrow (Monday). TEMESA was established under the authority of the Executive Agencies Act No. 30 of 1997 by an Establishment Order by the Minister for Works through Government Notice No. 254 of 26th August 2005. TEMESA was created in the spirit of Act of No. 30 of 1997, which was to improve services and increase both effectiveness and efficiency of operations. TEMESA was specifically established to provide efficient and effective electrical, mechanical and electronic services, reliable and safe ferry transport services and hiring of equipment to government institutions and the public at large
