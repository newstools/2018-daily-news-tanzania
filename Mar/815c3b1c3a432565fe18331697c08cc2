He has been doing everything in his power to intensity the war for the betterment of the people,” he said. He advised TSN journalists who normally go for exchange programmes in China to learn more about anti-corruption fight and publish as many stories as possible to educate the society on the matter. On his side, TSN Managing Editor (ME), Dr Jim Yonazi said that the company is ready to share knowledge regarding the anti-corruption war, which is in-line with other burning issues. He added that TSN has become a creative institution which focuses on profit making, sharing information and promoting the company in a modern way.
