The Minister explained further that all assets and liabilities of TRL and RAHCO will be transferred to TRC, including the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) whose construction from Dar es Salaam to Morogoro is underway. “It is now up to the employees of the new company to work efficiently to make TRC a business oriented corporation for economic development of Tanzania,” he stressed. At the same occasion, Mr Kadogosa said the merging of TRL and RAHCO will boost investment in the company, coupled with capability and management of the new company. “The decision to form one company to oversee the management of railways in our country is to ensure quality provision of railway services to the citizens,” he said, noting that the formed company will also help in development of resources. He expressed commitment of the company in increasing productivity by working day and night to achieve the government set vision. On the other hand, Permanent Secretary (PS) in the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communication (responsible for transport), Dr Leonard Chamuriho, urged residents along the railway line to cooperate with the new company in the implementation of the SGR project. Before the year 2007, TRC operated as a single entity before it was split into two companies namely TRL and RAHCO. At that time operations of trains were leased to RITES Limited of India which had won a 25-year concession to run the railway from the then Presidential Parastatal Sector Reform Commission (PSRC). TRC was established in the year 1977 after the dissolution of the then East African Railways and Harbours Corporation, whose assets were divided between Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda
