The Director for Policy Advocacy with Tanzania Private Sector Foundation (TPSF), Mr Gilead Teri, disclosed that the move was made possible following dialogue and intervention by TPSF and USAID’s East Africa Trade Hub. “A tonne of rice was formerly exported at $300, but following on the dialogue and interventions by TPSF and USAID’s East Africa Trade Hub (the Hub), the charges have been waived ‘by 100 per cent.’ Tariffs for agricultural produce have also gone down from the former five to three per cent, just as the fees related to the sector such as fertilisers charges,” said Mr Teri. He pointed out that the partnership also pushed for the elimination of the 18 per cent VAT on auxiliary services in the clearance of goods which was a hefty burden for traders and business owners. “The reforms have witnessed a lot of changes as well as improved movements of goods, services and helped business growth and boost the economy of the sector and country,” he noted. Mr Teri also cited lack of awareness, issues of permits and transportation on EAC Common Market Protocol in practice as some challenges facing the Tanzania business community. However, the project made the awareness possible … which helped Tanzanians penetrate the outside market. Key among it initiatives, the TSPF helped conduct two dialogues with its counterparts in Kenya and Rwanda on harmonisation of agenda towards East African Common Market realisation, strengthening of private sector and elimination of non-tariff barriers impeding trade in the region. The Hub project has not only been beneficial to Tanzania businesses and investors, but has helped our neighbours just as much. “TPSF will continue to work in its own capacity to facilitate trade in the region through continued policy advocacy and interventions by eliminations of such barriers through its numerous regional dialogue platforms, as well as ensure compliance as per the agreed EAC-CMP,” observed the Director
