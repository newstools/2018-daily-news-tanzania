BRELA Chief Executive Officer and Registrar of Companies, Frank Kanyusi told reporters in Dar es Salaam yesterday that the verification exercise was of paramount significance for businessmen since they will no longer need to travel all the way to Dar es Salaam because everything can be done online. “ We want their information to be verified by themselves before loading them in the online system. Those companies registered from February 1, this year, their information is already loaded in the system as required,” he said. He said for local company owners, they will be needed to put their numbers of Tax Payers Identification Number (TIN) and their National Identity Cards issued by National Identification Authority (NIDA) numbers. “For non-citizens or foreigners who own companies they will be required to put the numbers of their valid travelling passports,” Mr. Kanyusi explained, noting that from now onwards there will be no paper work because everything is to be conducted on line. According to BRELA boss, by the end of April this year, his agency will officially launch this system and issuance of Licence Grade A while Licence Grade B will be issued by councils countrywide. “ It is my optimism that everyone will now enjoy our online services, reducing the unnecessary movements for a person requiring our services. They will click the website and follow the instructions,” he stressed. Earlier, the Agency’s Head of Companies Section, Ms Rehema Kitambi said BRELA has reserved a special room for businessmen who want to learn more about online services. She also appealed to Tanzanians to utilize BRELA online services if they want to formalize their businesses, saying it has already moved from analogue to digital to save time and increase work efficiency. For the last three years running, BRELA has been taking deliberate measures to improve its services, including that of sensitizing traders and businessmen countrywide to register their businesses and win legal status
