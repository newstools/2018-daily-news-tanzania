The University of Dodoma (UDOM) lecturer, Dr January Basele, issued the advice here recently at a Conference on Making Education Effective for Persons with Disabilities in Tanzania, saying unfavourable environment for the PWD had become a serious setback. “It’s high time schools improved their infrastructure to accommodate people with disabilities,” said the UDOM’s don who doubles as Head of Department of Psychology at the College of Education. The one-day UDOM organised workshop brought together people with disabilities and key education stakeholders to deliberate on strategies to make education efficient for PWD. Three papers were presented at the conference which was funded by the Open Society Initiative for Eastern Africa. “We came up with the idea to host the conference to hear different views from education stakeholders on how best to carry out the inclusive education system,” said acting Principal of the College of Education at UDOM, Dr Enedy Mlaki
