Meanwhile, until February, this year the region had produced 2,551,000 tonnes of various food crops, which is equivalent to 65 per cent of the target, he said. According to the RC, the region's projection was to produce 3,876,000 tonnes during 2017/18 season. He appealed to residents in the area to utilise the ongoing rains by planting food crops. People should utilise the ongoing rains by planting fast maturing food crops including sweet potatoes, cassava and millet. People should also avoid selling food randomly. This will enable the region to have surplus food reserve, he said.
