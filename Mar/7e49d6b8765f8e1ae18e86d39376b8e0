Mr Mwijage noted here on Tuesday evening that the vast area would accommodate a variety of small and medium entrepreneurs in the designated capital city, hence help promote the industrial revolution. He was speaking at a ceremony to unveil a 13- acre plot of land at Kizota area where the Small Industries Development Organisation (SIDO) will put up its infrastructure for small and medium industries. Mr Mwijage said the government had set aside massive funds to facilitate small and medium entrepreneurship, saying the goal was to provide small and medium entrepreneurs with start-up business loans. “… I appeal to small and medium entrepreneurs to apply for the loans after receiving entrepreneurship skills in order to use the fund wisely,” the minister said. Mr Mwijage pointed out that small and medium industries were vital for the country’s bid to attain a middle income economy status. SIDO Regional Manager, Mr Sempeho Manongi, said the Kizota area would house some 35 small industries and 10 middle industries, saying the industries would create posts of 200 employments. He said SIDO had already acquired the fund to put up the infrastructure for small and medium industries in Kizota, saying the feasibility study for the project was complete and the construction will soon kick off. Dodoma Urban Member of Parliament and Deputy Minister in Prime Minister’s Office (Labour, Youth, Employment and People with Disabilities), Mr Anthony Mavunde, said residents in his constituency were ready to take part fully in the industrial economy. The industry is currently a major and growing component in the country’s economy contributing immensely in national income.
