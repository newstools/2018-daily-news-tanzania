Mkinga community is currently experiencing water supply problem in that there is neither reliable nor safe water source available. Four sub-villages (Mkinga, Mtenguleni, Mwakihonda and Karoyo) depend on piped water distribution from the old main water tank which receives water from the next village (Parangu Kasere). Mkinga Acting Municipal Director Eng Michael Gregory Ndunguru, who was the guest of honour at the launching event said, “Today is a historic day for Mkinga residents, as by launching this project here in our district, our residents can finally have access to safe water at all times. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank Water Missions International Tanzania and partners for complementing the government’s efforts to address water shortage in our communities.” Eng Ndunguru, said this project will benefit hundreds of Mkinga residents, especially women who had been spending hours trekking in search for clean water for their families. The DC called on Mkinga residents to be cooperative and support the NGO’s initiative by keeping the water infrastructure safe to ensure sustainability of the project. “This project is significant to the people of Mkinga and will help reduce the rate of waterborne diseases, as we now have safe water which is suitable for domestic use unlike previously,” he added. The Community Development Coordinator of Water Missions International Tanzania, Mr Isack Abdiel said, “We are delighted to officially launch this water project in Mkinga District which shows our continuous support to the government towards ensuring provision of clean and safe water as well as addressing water shortages in local communities. “It is our hope that the community will support in preserving the water infrastructure, to ensure that this project is sustainable and benefits the future generation as well.”
