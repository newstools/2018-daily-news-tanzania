In an effort to resolve water woes in some parts of Dar es Salaam and Coast region which have been facing acute water scarcity, DAWASA has been undertaking construction of several mega projects in Dar es salaam which some of them have been completed and others are near completion. The projects aims at achieving the government’s set target of 95 and 75 per cent of people with access to safe and clean water in urban and rural areas by 2025, among the projects include the expansion of Upper and Lower Ruvu water treatment plants in Mlandizi and Bagamoyo respectively which has already been completed and have increased its water supply capacity from 92 million litres to 196 million litres per day at the Upper Ruvu and from 182 million litres to 270 million litres at Lower Ruvu. Apart from that DAWASA has unveiled that the implementation drilling of 20 deep boreholes at Kimbiji and Mpera in Kigamboni municipality which are expected to pump in an additional 260 million litres per day, is going on well and on its completion areas of Kinyerezi, Pugu, Ukonga, Gongo la Mboto, Yombo, Vituka, Kiwalani, Airport and its vicinity, Kibada , Kigamboni and Geza Ulole will benefit from the project and end their long-cry of water scarcity. The first phase of Kimbiji and Mpera boreholes drilling have been completed and currently Dawasa is waiting for funds from China’s Exim bank to enable them to commence the second and last phase of the project. A total of 12 of the completed boreholes at Kimbiji have the capacity of producing 350,000 litres of water to 500,000 litres per day will be connected to four tanks which will supply about 200,000 expected water consumers. Due to these efforts, the usual scene of long queues of people especially women and girls waiting for their turn to draw water and fill their buckets from a well or only available water pump for drinking, washing their clothes or cooking, is likely to be history soon after the completion of those projects under Dawasa. “We are doing a great job in ensuring people have access to safe and clean water in Dar es Salaam as you have witnessed for yourselves during the five day tour with the Deputy Minister for Water and Irrigation Jumaa Aweso and with his support and the ministry in general we are positive the set target of 95 and 75 per cent by 2020 will be achieved,” Dawasa’s Deputy Technical Director Modester Mushi said. Dawasa is confident of achieving the target set as many of their projects are going well and those which have been completed have led to an increase of water production enabling them to expand safe and clean water network coverage by building new ones and renovating the old ones. According to Modester, the increase of safe and clean water production and extension of network coverage will now enable people to no longer rely on ponds, streams or wells producing unsafe water and thus reduces the possibility of outbreaks of waterborne diseases. Furthermore apart from the above mentioned project, Dawasa has also completed a mega project of a 10 million litre reservoir water tank at Kibamba which receives water from Upper Ruvu and supplies to several areas of Dar es Salaam which is another major step in resolving water woes in Dar es Salaam and Coast regions. Others projects are the 72bn/-water projects currently being undertaken at Makongo Juu, Bunju, Changanyikeni and Bagamoyo town , the project implemented by contractor, Jain Irrigation Company from India, would serve over 500,000 residents of Dar es Salaam and Coast regions. Apart from ensuring the increase of safe and clean water production and expansion of its coverage network, Dawasa is also working on improving of sewerage and sanitation system in Dar es Salaam city and is expecting to launch a mega project of constructing contemporary sewerage plants as part of its effort to ease sewerage congestion in the city. DAWASA’s Deputy Director for Technical Services, Modester Mushi disclosed that through government support and donors such as the World Bank (WB) and South Korea government, Dawasa is going to launch three projects of constructing modern sewerage plants at Jangwani, Kurasini and Mbezi Beach areas as part of extending sewerage network coverage in the city especially in the areas which are not in the network. Mushi said that the city of Dar es Salaam official sewerage network only covers 10 per cent and that the three projects to be established in Jangwani with the capacity of 200,000 litres per day, Mbezi Beach (16,000) and Kurasini (12,000) respectively, will enable Dawasa to expand the network to 30 per cent after the first phase of the projects. The second phase which will be implemented after securing funds will aim at extending the sewerage coverage network for Dar es Salaam to reach 50 per cent and later 100 per cent and this is being efforts to fight against outbreak communicable diseases cause by related waterborne diseases and filthy such as cholera. The projects will cover about 576 kilometres of the areas which are yet to be reached by the sewerage network coverage among them being Mbezi Beach whereby Dawasa will establish its network as well as improving the old network infrastructures in areas which were already in the network. The Deputy Minister for Water and Irrigation, Mr Jumaa Aweso during his five day tour in Dar es Salaam Region insisted on the water agencies in ensuring water projects are well taken care, supervised and handled with credible contractors in an effort to ensure they are well executed and avoid people’s complaints to their government. The completion of all those implemented projects by Dawasa will see the people of Dar es Salaam and Coast regions soon kiss goodbye to frequent water woes.
