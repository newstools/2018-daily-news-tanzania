Dr Makota was the guest of honor during the opening of the first national stakeholderâ€™s workshop on preparation of national waste management strategy in Tanzania. He pointed out that the collection of waste in various cities in the country is below 50 per cent, and that the remaining 50 percent of waste is left to rot on streets. He added that Dar es Salaam city alone is currently estimated to generate 4,600 tons of solid waste per day on average from the previous 4,200 tons it used to generate per day.
