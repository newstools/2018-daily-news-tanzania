The current village chairperson, Mr Vincent Sharia told ‘The Daily News’ here that the incident occurred on March 11, this year at around 10:00 pm when the deceased was asleep. Mr Sharia said that on the fateful day, unidentified people broke the main door and did the same on the living room before they stormed into the bedroom demanding money. He said that soon after telling them that he had no money, they started slashing him at random, using machetes. “After realizing that he was unconscious or presumably dead, they left the place immediately to an unknown destination,” he explained, adding: “His wife, who all along was silently lying under the bed appeared from her hiding and started screaming for help from neighbours”. However, Sharia said when the neighbours arrived at the scene they found the old man was already dead, apparently from damaging injuries sustained on his head, back, arms and other parts of his body. Iramba District Commissioner, Mr Emmanuel Luhahula confirmed the incident and promised to give clarification later. He said police were still investigating.
