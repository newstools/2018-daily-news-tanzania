Speaking during an occasion to mark tax payers’ week in Arusha, the Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr Mrisho Gambo, revealed that the TRA office in Arusha had crafted a special arrangement with the National Identification Authority (NIDA) so that the two institutions can help local businessmen and women to acquire the electronic National Identity Cards (IDs). The two-week exercise started yesterday and would stretch to March 18th. According to RC Gambo, the export and import business generated lots of money in terms of revenue and it was upon the authorities to ensure that businesspersons were empowered to undertake such activities without hindrances . Now that Arusha businesspersons are being assisted to get new e-passports, the National IDs apparently are important certification that immigration offices would request upon the clients application of the new electronic travel documents the State released recently. The Regional TRA Manager, Mr Faustine Mdesa, reinforced the importance of business entities to acquire EFD (Electronic Fiscal Devices) machines and that the gadgets were required for traders whose transactions rake in between 1.14 million/- per month, or the cumulative 14 million/- per year. “Most businesspersons in Arusha earn a lot, sometimes nearly 40,000/- per day and yet they claim to be doing ‘little business’ while in reality the EFD machines are a must for businesses whose daily transactions are valued at 38,000/-,” he said. The TRA manager used the platform to warn businesspeople who fix two forms of pricing; cheaper retail for those who will not take electronic receipts and expensive ones for the customers that demand official cash sale documents. The national taxpayers’ week will also involve community education strategies in Arusha Regi
