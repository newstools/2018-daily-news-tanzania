He gave the call here yesterday when opening a four-day stakeholders’ training session on sound chemical management.The upshot was to equip them with the do’s and don’ts when it comes to handling chemicals. “The safety of the wananchi and the environment is a priority which cannot be compromised. Thus you have to be carefully in your business transactions when handling chemicals since mishandling them can result in hazardous effects,” he cautioned. Prof Manyele said those who will be found to contravene the rules and regulations will face sanctions and their penalty will be based on their capital. He called for strict management and control saying that the state, through the Government Chemists Laboratory Authority (GCLA), has intensified measures to ensure there is sound management of chemicals. “We have set up a strong system for chemical management for both imported and local varieties. Therefore manufacturers, distributors and warehouses must observe the code of conduct,” he insisted. Prof Manyele also directed them not to sell any kind of chemicals to unregistered personnel in order to minimize harm. All drivers who transport chemicals must have requisite certificates with them as it is the case with the driving licence. The training attended by participants from Dodoma, Morogoro, Tabora and Singida is also meant to equip them with knowledge on how to handle chemicals in case of accidents so that no effects can be caused to human and environment. He was impressed by the increasing number of people and institutions registering with GCLA for handling chemicals but they offer certificates only to those with the required qualifications and training.
