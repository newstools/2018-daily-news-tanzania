The services were halted for 48 days due to heavy repairs of part of the railway line damaged by floods in Morogoro Region. Speaking to journalists in Dar es Salaam yesterday, TRL Acting Managing Director, Mr Focus Sahani, said the organisation has lost over 1.6 billion for the days in which the train stopped operations. He said the train terminated routes from Dar es Salaam to upcountry since 11th January, this year, after floods caused by heavy rains damaged the railway infrastructure between Gulwe and Kilosa areas. Due to the destruction, TRL suspended its passenger coach trips between Dar es Salaam and upcountry destinations, noting, however, that technicians have already restored the situation and operations are scheduled to start on Friday 2nd, March, this week. “TRL’s management has been satisfied that the railway line at the area is now safe to pass after conducting assessment for rehabilitation which took more than a month to be completed,” he said. The train is scheduled to start operation this Friday evening at around 3:00hrs from Dar es Salaam station to Kigoma Region through Morogoro, Dodoma and Tabora. Mr Sahani said the trains will continue to operate according to the normal timetable. On behalf of the company, he apologised to customers for any inconvenience caused. TRL
