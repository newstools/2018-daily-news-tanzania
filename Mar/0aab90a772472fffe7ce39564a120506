This was revealed by the Chairman of Chato District Council, Mr Batholomeo Manuga during a weeklong visit by some members from the media in Chato and Geita Township and District. According to Mr Manuga, much as the free education policy has boosted enrollment of pupils and secondary students, the TASAF programme has also played a very big role. “The programme has enabled parents to buy school uniforms and food for their children who for lack of those basic requirements, failed to constantly attend classes,” said Mr Manuga. He said that there was a shortage of classrooms in the district because of the programmes and cited the example of a school in Bongela Ward whereby in 2014 it had 37 students, the year after the number went up to 550 and this year the pupils enrolled there stood at 1,000. “This programme has indeed upgraded the status of the district considering that poor households are now engaging into some forms of income generating activities, improved their homes and standard of living. Earlier on because of their situation, school who were supposed to go to school had to help their parents in income generation activities,” noted the Chairman. The Headmistress of Kalangalala Primary School located in Geita Township Council, Ms Regina Keatu revealed challenges endured by teachers before the TASAF programme including pupils dozing in class because of hunger. Ms Keatu pointed out that students would often go to class hungry because of poverty and teachers went out of their way to buy the pupils something to eat so that they can concentrate in class. “We thank the government for introducing the programme, notable achievements have been realised, academic performance has gone up and they are very determined in class...am sure they are going to reach their goals,” observed Ms Keatu. She requested the government to continue supporting this children’s education even after their households have graduated from the programme
