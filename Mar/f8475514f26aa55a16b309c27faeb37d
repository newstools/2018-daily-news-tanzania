The Head of Department of Educational Foundations and Continuing Education at UDOM’s College of Education, Dr Joseph Manase, noted here over the weekend that about 80 residents of Ng’ong’ona area had enrolled in the programme. “After reaching communities surrounding UDOM, we plan to extend the programme to entire Dodoma Region,” said the don during an event tailored to officially launch the programme at Ngo’ng’ona Secondary School which will be used as a centre for offering the programme. He pointed out that UDOM came up with the programme after a survey to establish that at least two persons in every household in communities surrounding UDOM campus were illiterate. Dr Manase said the survey, which was conducted by UDOM, had discovered about 3,000 illiterate persons in communities surrounding the UDOM campus, pointing out the areas as Ngo’ongo’na, Iyumbu, Ntyuka and Makulu. “The study discovered that at least two persons in every household were illiterate. There are about 12,000 residents in communities surrounding our campus,” he said. Dr Manase expressed gratitude to the outgoing Vice Chancellor of UDOM, Prof Idris Kikula, for the idea of literacy programme to surrounding communities, noting that the programme was an ideal legacy. “We’re grateful to Prof Kikula for the idea for our College of Education to teach our neighbours who are lacking primary education to read and write,” he said.
