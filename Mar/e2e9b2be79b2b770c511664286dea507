He said District Executive Directors (DEDs) and Chairmen of the respective Councils should make sure they closely supervise the rural roads’ constructions and only award tenders to competent contractors. “Roads are important because they hasten development by enabling people at the grassroots to transport their crops to the markets….I would like to caution residents also in the area to be vigilant and ensure infrastructures like roads are not vandalized because they cost taxpayers millions of shillings,” Mr Kijuu further said. The DC pointed out that the region was among the few areas with standard passable roads which should be maintained, adding: “ Councils in Muleba, Bukoba, Biharamulo, Ngara, Karagwe, Kyerwa and Misenyi Districts should set aside some funds to maintain and repair them, instead of solely depending on the central government’s budget.” He emphasized that the culture of depending solely on the central government should be put aside because the latter’s budget was very tight. On his side, Tanzania National Roads Agency (Tanroads)-Kagera Regional Manager, Engineer Andrea Kasamwa, cited the 154 kms Mutukula- Kagoma-Lusahunga road that would be completed at a total cost of 159.685 bn/- and the 59.1 kms Kyaka-Bugene road at 64.961bn/-. In another development, he cautioned unruly drivers who overload their vehicles including the ones who spill petrol and oil to stop the habit because they damage the roads
