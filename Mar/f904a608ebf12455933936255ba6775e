Presenting the Plan and Budget Estimates for 2018/2019 before the councillors special meeting, Mr Deus Luziga, the Economist for the Council said that the earmarked revenue collections were higher by 9.2 per cent to 2017/2018 estimates. He said that the council expects to collect 3.83bn/- from its various domestic sources and additional 42.43bn/- earmarked to be received from development partners and the central government as grants. “Out of the amount expected to be collected, 18.5bn/- belongs to recurrent expenditure, 12.3bn/- is for development projects and 29.5bn/- is for salaries” Mr Luziga explained. He further said that a total amount of 457.4 m/- is expected to be collected from the health sector through Community Health Fund (CHF), on the spot treatment charges and the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF).
