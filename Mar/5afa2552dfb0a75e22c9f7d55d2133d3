As President John Magufuli plans to lay a foundation stone for the construction of a 336- km long line from Morogoro to Makutupora in Dodoma this Wednesday, Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA) says works on the mega dry port in the country’s capital was gathering tempo. “This is the initial stage of the government- funded SGR line. After the Dar es Salaam- Dodoma line, the government will extend the SGR line to Mwanza some 1,219km and other parts,” he said. The total cost from Dar es Salaam to Mwanza is estimated at 15trn/-. The 522-km long Dar- Dodoma line is implemented by the Turkish based firms. The state owned Reli Assets Holding Company (Rahco) said at least 7trn/- would be spent on constructing the country’s first speed railway. The dry port in Dodoma is planned for Ihumwa, some 20 km from Dodoma’s downtown enroute to Dar es Salaam. The area is further expected to host the ceremony this week when President John Magufuli will cut the ribbon to okay the construction of the SGR line that the government and economists say will open up new doors for development in the central regions. “This line is crucial for the economic development of these regions. It will also help ease the flow of goods and people in the neighbouring countries - Kenya, Uganda, Zambia, Dr Congo, Burundi and Rwanda,” Dr Mahenge said at a press conference.
