“… in Mara region alone 150 villages are set to get electricity under REA III and the work is already underway,” REA Director of Technical Services, Eng Bengiel Msofe confirmed this on Thursday last week. Eng Msofe spoke to the ‘Daily News’ when the Energy and Minerals Parliamentary Committee visited villages being connected with electricity under REA III in Butiama district. Led by its chairman, Mr Dunstun Kitandula, the Committee got a rare opportunity to ‘light up’ electricity at Nyabange village in Butiama District for the first time. The deputy minister for Energy, Ms Subira Mgalu told the committee that three villages had since been successfully connected to electricity in Butiama under REA III programme. “… already, there is electricity at Muriaza and Buzwege …. today, this committee will have opportunity to light power at Nyabange village,” Ms Subira said, on her brief report to the House team. The beneficiaries who include secondary school students thanked the fifth phase government under President John Magufuli for making it possible for their areas to get electricity. “First we wish to thank the government for bringing electricity in our villages,” Butiama District Council Chairman, Mr Magina Magesa said. Meanwhile, REA Director of Technical Services, Eng Msofe has underscored the importance for adequate funding to facilitate efforts by the agency to connect more villages to the mainstream power grid.
