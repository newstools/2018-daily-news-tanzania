According to the Deputy Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism, Mr Japhet Hasunga, even some public institutions have already set up offices in the illegally established villages in the forest reserves. Mr Hasunga was speaking at the closure of a month-long course on “Paramilitary Transformation Leadership,” at Lwafi Training Centre in Mlele District in Katavi region. The course that officially started on February 26 through March 24, 2018 attracted 108 Senior Wardens from Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority (NCAA) and Tanzania Forest Services (TFS) . The course aimed at equipping the trainees with sophisticated military skills which are currently applicable in areas where poachers have gone ‘modern.’ The Deputy Minister said the Ministries of State in the President’s Office, Regional Administration and Local Government; Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development; Livestock and Fisheries; and Natural Resources and Tourism were on deliberations to get the lasting solution to the problem . Mr Hasunga blamed the invasion of forest reserves to lack of collective responsibility and coordination in the past. “Following Prime Minister’s (Kassim Majaliwa) directives, already 80 per cent of the villages that border forests, game reserves and national parks have been identified in attempt to amicably solve the land dispute,” noted the deputy minister. Earlier, Mlele District Commissioner Rachel Kasanda told the deputy minister that her district was currently facing border challenges among villages, citing Ruangwa River Reserve and Inyonga Forest Reserves in which wananchi have established permanent settlements. She further noted that already some public institutions have set up offices, with local government leaders elected, charging that it’s difficult to handle such villages during anti-invasion operations
