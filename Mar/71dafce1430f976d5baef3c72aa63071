The Fund Secretary, Ms Justina Mashiba said UCSAF had now identified 109 schools where each school will receive five computers as it rolls out a countrywide initiative. “Our focus is to ensure communication services is accessible everywhere especially in remote communities. We’re also working to ensure our initiative succeeds by connecting all public schools with access to internet to fully utilise ICT facilities,” she said at the University of Dodoma. The Fund in collaboration with the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communication has trained at least 327 teachers from 109 schools across the country to operate and use computers in teachings at their schools. The just ended training session was conducted by Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology (DIT) and the University of Dodoma (UDOM) and was officiated last Monday by Deputy Minister Atashasta Nditiye on behalf of Prof Makame Mbarawa. According to Ms Mashimba, the current session was the second in a series of more to come. Last year, some 286 teachers received similar training. Deputy Minister Nditiye acknowledged that the training would help students and pupils improve their academic performance. He said there was a widening digital gap in digital literacy and that the new initiative by UCSAF would plug it up. “This is an attempt by the government to ensure an inclusive growth to its people,” he said, urging teachers to ensure they helped pupils in primary schools and students in secondary schools to fully utilise the benefits of ICT facilities at their schools. Prof Aloyce Mvuma, Dean of the School of Computer Science, Information and Communication at the University of Dodoma said the university was ready to offer practical trainings to teachers to ensure they master the new ICT skills. “After the trainings we will ensure we also train our fellow teachers so that the knowledge attained in Dodoma reaches a wider audience,” said Sammy Charles Sanga, a teacher and beneficiary from Italima in Simiyu Region
