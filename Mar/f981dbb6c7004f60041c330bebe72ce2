Speaking at the opening of the recent General Council Meeting of Inter-Parastatal and Parastatal Sports Federation (SHIMMUTA) here, Ms Hassan said the hospital has registered massive achievement within a short time. “We have no need to travel to oversee to seek health services like kidney transplant because the healthcare is now available at Benjamin Mkapa Hospital,” the Vice-President said at the meeting which was held at the University of Dodoma (UDOM). Last week, doctors at BMH made a breakthrough yet again after performing kidney transplant to a 51-year old man, a resident of Mvumi in Chamwino District, Dodoma. According to the BMH Executive Director, Dr Alphonce Chandika, a team of 10 doctors performed the kidney transplant to Mr Elias Sweti who had kidney complications. “Both, the kidney recipient Elias Sweti and his 45- year old kidney donor Neema Sweti are doing well after the operations,” the BMH Executive Director told reporters at a UDOM and Japanese Medical Group of Kamakura joint press conference. Dr Chandika pointed out that five local doctors teamed up with their five visiting counterparts to perform the first kidney transplant at BMH after MNH performed the first operation in the country last November. “We plan to perform the second kidney transplant to another patient with kidney complications next June,” he added. Last year, BMH became the first health facility in the Central Zone to offer Magnet Resonance Imaging (MRI) and CT Scan services.
