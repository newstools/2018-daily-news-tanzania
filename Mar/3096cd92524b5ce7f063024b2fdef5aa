Ms Mgalu said that the government was finalising preparations for extension of the project to the area, including tender announcement for contractors and site evaluation. “We are yet to award the contractor to start installation of the rural electricity in all the eligible peri-urban areas in Ukonga,” she said when addressing public rally at some of the villages lined up for rural electrification in Ukonga Constituency. Ms Mgalu was accompanied by Ukonga MP, Mr Mwita Waitara and Senior officials from Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO) and Rural Energy Agency (REA). She said electricity project in the area would be implemented under the third phase of REA project. Ms Mgalu who called for patience from the residents said that some 187 villages in Ukonga peri-urban areas are set to be connected to rural electrification. She said the development of rural electrification in the peri-urban areas including Kigamboni, Kisarawe and Coast Region is set to be completed in June 2020. Earlier, the residents of the areas expressed disappointment with the government delay to connect them with electricity. Speaking during the rallies, local government leaders told Ms Mgalu that the villages for a long time lacked electricity, which impact negatively on their social and economic development. “Despite that we are experiencing a lot of problems, such as theft with some of innocent people being invaded and killed,” said Chairperson of Virobo Village in Chanika, Mr Rajabu Churus.
