Addressing members of the press here yesterday, the Minister called on all agricultural stakeholders to start preparations for the exhibition. "We have set Simiyu to host this year's exhibition. We expect the region after showing willingness it will also hold the next exhibition planned for 2019," the Minister said. For three consecutive years the annual event was held at Ngongo grounds in Lindi opening up opportunities for small and large agriculture investors to interrupt and deliberate on challenges and opportunities facing the sector. Dr Tizeba says the decision to send the exhibition in the Eastern side of the Lake Zone will allow regions that had no fully representation in the previous event to also take part. "These events are coordinated and must be revolving throughout the regions in the country. It's time for Simiyu and we need to offer all the needed support," the minister said noting that the regional authorities had agreed to move on with the arrangement. It was not immediately known whether there will be experts from foreign countries who would attend and offer trainings during the farmers' showcase event. But the minister made it clear that Tanzania Agricultural Society (Taso) which co-helped in organising the event has been deregistered. Regarding production, the minister says the ongoing rains is a clear signs for good harvest noting further that the state authorities have been up to educate farmers and assist especially on controlling pests.
