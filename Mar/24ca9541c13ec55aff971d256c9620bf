The 2017 statistics bring the total number of patients cared for since its inception four years ago to over 158,000. “I really appreciate that this service has been bringing to our island,” Ms Asha Ruhenga, a resident of Chakazimbwe Island, said. A partnership between the African Inland Church of Tanzania, the Vine Trust of Scotland and Geita Gold Mining Limited (GGML), the boat seeks to extend primary healthcare services to the 450,000 inhabitants of the Lake Victoria Islands. GGML supports the Medical Boat by providing fuel and maintenance costs. The boat offers a variety of critical services, including vaccinations, maternal healthcare, voluntary HIV testing, dentistry and general primary health education and care, with a focus on maternal and child-health. It also offers basic lab services as well as a general pharmacy, with all services free of charge to the patients. “We are proud that in its inaugural year, the boat reached over 46,000 people, with the majority being women and children living in remote islands where access to healthcare is a serious challenge,” Pastor Samuel Limbe, the General Secretary of the African Inland Church in Tanzania in Geita district, said. The Medical Boat rotates between the Lake Victoria Islands for two weeks and docks back in Mwanza for refuelling, refurnishing medicine stock and general maintenance, before restarting its route. It is the first hospital of its kind in East and Central Africa.
