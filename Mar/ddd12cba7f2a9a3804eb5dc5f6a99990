The police arrested the councillor alleged to have been involved in illegal sale of land at Mwembe-Majoggo on the outskirts of Zanzibar Stone Town. “We are holding the man as investigation continues. It is alleged that he received 150,000/- from a person who needs to develop a plot,” Ms Mwanaidi Suleiman, ZAECA public relations officer told reporters here yesterday. She said her institution is committed to the fight against corruption and will spare nobody regardless of their political status, appealing to members of the public to support the fight by exposing corrupt leaders. In a separate interview, the alleged councillor dismissed the charges, saying, “Yes, I received the money from my electorate, just to help him get construction permit, quickly. I have no intention to demand bribe.” Meanwhile, the police here have arrested another councillor, accused of playing a key role in the illegal sale of land at 6m/-. “We have arrested the councillor and three others over illegal sale of land ... they will be charged after investigations,” said Mr Hassan Nassir Ali, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP). During recent tour of different parts of Unguja and Pemba Islands, President Ali Mohamed Shein warned leaders, including councillors and community leaders, Shehas, against getting involved in land deals.
