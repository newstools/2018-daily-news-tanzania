The minister for Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, Dr Harrison Mwakyembe told lawmakers of the House Public Service and Social Development Committee, “… we want to know the exact number of available professional Kiswahili teachers.” He said the plan would help the government allocate teachers across the globe depending on the demand of professional teachers, adding that the database would also act as a gateway for more job opportunities within and outside the country. “We have agreed to make the process more affordable … an applicant needs to pay a registration fee of just 10,000/-,” he told parliamentarians. Meanwhile, the minister commended the creativity that went to establish a business forum which MPs agreed would promote regional trade advertised within the country’s trade and services sectors. “The presence of the forum in Simiyu, Mwanza, Shinyanga, Tanga and Zanzibar regions has been a major factor in ensuring that various commercial opportunities are being publicised and utilised,” he said. The minister also explained that the government through its state broadcaster had increased coverage from 52 per cent to 88 per cent. “The plan is to cover the entire nation … we’re talking of 100 per cent coverage,” he noted. Apparently, the minister revealed that the strategy was aimed at expanding TBC network coverage to the Isles’ Pemba and Unguja to ensure every individual got access to the national television and radio station. “We’ll increase the budget allocation to ensure the plan is attained … we’ve since released over 3bn/-,” he added
