The tzNIC Chief Executive Officer Abibu Ntahigiye said during a workshop held in Dar es Salaam yesterday that, “We have to change the wrong perception of the public that local products are substandard an support our own made things,” Ntahigiye added that to this date only 15,000+ .tz domains have been registered with yet many more businesses, organisations and entities operating in Tanzania without the domain. He said the domain will not only give them local relevance but also position as a more trusted and credible entity on a global scale. He said a tzNIC which is responsible for administration and management of the .tz registry is designing a communication campaign to promote the benefits of usage of the local domain ‘’.tz’’ The Registry is designing a communication campaign to promote the benefits of usage of the local domain “.tz’’ As part of the process, a communication design workshop involving all .tz stakeholder groups was held this week in Dar es Salaam , attended by different stakeholders including some members from COSTECH, MOAT, students from UDSM as well as different domain registrars and resellers. It was established and incorporated in 2006 as a not for profit and member-based company, with a mission of promoting the utilisation of .tz domain names and to protect registrants’ interests, by ensuring reliable and secure registry infrastructure and database as well as affordable domain names. The Executive secretary of Media Owners Association Tanzania (MOAT) Mr Henry Muhanika, commented on the need for all media houses to contribute in promoting the local domain in order to increase public awareness. “Majority of Tanzanians tend to trust a website with “.com” than with a “.tz,” but the case is different in other countries where people tend to trust local domains due to the credibility of the issuing entity. It is time the public is made aware of the benefits of using a local domain,” said another participant in the workshop. While many factors have contributed to the low uptake of the domain, absence of effective and continuous communication campaign has been one of the top reasons.
