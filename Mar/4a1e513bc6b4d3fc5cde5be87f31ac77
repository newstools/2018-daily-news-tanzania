The directive was issued by Deputy Minister for Water and Irrigation, Mr Jumaa Aweso, after a five-day tour on DAWASCO network and received a heap of complains regarding unrealistic billing. The minister said it was not fair for a customer to receive incorrect bill, which in most cases they failed to pay and resulted to water service disconnection. During his visit to the Mburahati Barafu Sewarage project under the Ubungo Municipal, the residents of Mburahati complained to Mr Aweso that Dawasco have been providing them with unrealistic bills which they fail to afford paying and resulting their water network connections being disconnected. Yusuf Yenga a resident of Mburahati said they face little water problem today compared to the situation eight years ago where they depended on boreholes. Dawasco has done a commendable job. However, Mr Yenga said “the new challenge now is the unrealistic bills we get from Dawasco.” Nevertheless, Mr Aweso urged people to pay their water bills accordingly to enable DAWASCO to expand its network and serve its customer better. He said timely paying of their valid bills would enable the water providers to meet operational and infrastructural costs. Apart from ordering DAWASCO to issue proper water bills, the minister told them to improve and expand the availability of safe and clean water to the people of Dar es Salaam and Coast regions. The minister wanted DAWASA and DAWSCO to work closely with the five Dar es Salaam districts and its municipal councils to enable the realising of the set goal of providing water to 95 per cent of people in Dar and Coast regions by 2025. Among the efforts made by DAWASA includes the expansion of Upper and lower Ruvu water plants which now have increased its water production capacity per day and easing the water problem in Dar and Coast regions. DAWASA has constructed a 10 million water tank at Kibamba that will supply water to Segerea and Ukonga to reduce shortages.
