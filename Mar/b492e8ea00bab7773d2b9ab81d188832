Information, Culture, Arts and Sport Minister Dr Harrison Mwakyembe revealed here yesterday that the state broadcaster has already rolled out FM booster stations at Namanga and Tarakea borders in Arusha and Kilimanjaro regions, respectively. TBC is currently reviving its dormant stations at Loliondo in Ngorongoro, bringing to three the stations that will send TBC’s airwaves into the neighbouring Kenya. Other booster stations will be installed at Kibondo in Kigoma to send signals to Burundi and Tarime in Mara to enable TBC hub serve Kenya and across Lake Victoria to Entebbe, Uganda. Dr Mwakyembe was speaking at the launch of the state broadcaster’s new auxiliary studio at Themi Hills here where specialised community tailor-made radio programmes for Arusha, Manyara and Kilimanjaro regions will be aired for the Northern Zone residents. “I am told that, due to breakdown of the booster station in Loliondo, residents of Ngorongoro District now get radio broadcasts from the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC)...we want to reverse that,” said Dr Mwakyembe.
