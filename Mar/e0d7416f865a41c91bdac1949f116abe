They say that their school is facing a shortage of special studying materials for people with disabilities. They made the call here recently shortly after receiving wheelchairs and crutches for people with disabilities from the Albinism Awareness Foundation which said that most people with albinism cannot afford to purchase the studying materials. “We appeal to members of the public to support us. We will accept any materials which will facilitate people with disabilities,” said Melea Sewela while delivering a speech on behalf of his fellow pupils during the donation handing over ceremony at the school. Located at Buigiri Village some 34 kilometres from Dodoma Municipality, the Buigiri School for the Blind is one of the five schools that are operated by the Diocese of Central Tanganyika Anglican Church. Melea expressed gratitude to the Albinism Awareness Foundation for the donation, urging other Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) to emulate the foundation. “Our school still needs various materials because we will soon receive pupils with different disabilities,” he said adding that: “Our fellow pupils with albinism require special skin lotions to prevent cancer.” On his part, the Director of the Albinism Awareness Foundation, Mr Suleman Magoma, said his foundation decided to donate the aid after being touched by the challenges facing the school.
