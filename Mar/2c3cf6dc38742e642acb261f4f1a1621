Making the appreciation recently here while launching a ranger post built with the support of the EU through FZS, Serengeti District Commissioner (DC), Mr Nurdin Babu and FZS Country Director, Mr Gerald Bigurube pointed out that the global institution’s action(s) should also be emulated by other organizations “Ikona WMA is an essential part of Serengeti National Park and construction of this Ranger Post is a huge support to us. On behalf of the Tanzanian government and the people of Serengeti, I wish to thank EU for the support,” Mr Babu further said . The DC noted that the Ranger Post would help to boost security of the wildlife at Ikona Wildlife Management Area (WMA) since it forms integral part of the Serengeti ecosystem. He said the presence of the Ranger Post would also help to enhance security of tourists visiting Western Serengeti, to view beautiful wild animals, including the great annual migration of wildebeest. On his part, Mr Bigurube said his institution has spent nearly 150m/- for the Ranger Post construction, saying: “We thank EU for being one of the key partners in this great contribution on sustainable conservation of the Serengeti ecosystem.” Presiding over the event, the head of EU delegation to Tanzania and East African Community (EAC), Ambassador Roeland van de Geer, inaugurating the ranger post lauded the conservation of the Serengeti ecosystem as an important milestone in their development. “Serengeti is in Tanzania, but it is important in Africa too and indeed in the whole world,” the Ambassador said. He thanked the local villagers in the district for establishing the WMA programme, which apart from contributing to sustainable conservation of the Serengeti ecosystem, was also generating revenue to the government. In another development, Ambassador Roeland van de Geer further launched a Honey Processing Centre there that is expected to benefit more than 2,000 beekeepers in Serengeti District. As part of their funding also, the Honey Processing Centre was part of the EU continued funding to support the wildlife conservation(s) and human livelihoods through the FZS ther
