Morogoro Regional Police Commander (RPC) Ulrich Matei blamed the grisly head-on collision on over speeding of a Hiace, which was driven by Jackson Adam, one of people who died on the spot. “The driver of the Hiace recklessly attempted to overtake the lorry and rammed into the bus which was being driven by Mduika Manyema who was also in high speed,” the RPC told the ‘Daily News’ over the phone from Morogoro. He named the other four deceased as Witness Leonard (26) whose two daughters were also injured in the accident, Georgina Aloyce (35), Revocatha Lyimo and Mangasa Almasi. All were travelling in the Hiace. The RPC identified the injured as one-year old Caltimei and her two-year sister, Catherine Mhagama whose mother, Witness is among the dead. Other casualties are Prisca Isaya (25), Chuki Wage (40), Anthon Mhando (39), twins Innocent Emilian and Wilboard Emilian, Iman Amri and Ally Ramadhan. As we went to press last evening, the injured were still receiving medical treatment at Morogoro Regional Referral hospital where they were rushed after the accident. The bodies of deceased are preserved at the same hospital, pending burial arrangement. Mr Matei said the New Force bus driver is under police custody for interrogation and further investigations into the accident. He said according to circumstantial evidences, the bus was in high speed, leading to failure by the driver to control the vehicle to avoid the accident. The RPC reminded drivers and all road users to observe road safety rules to avoid accidents
