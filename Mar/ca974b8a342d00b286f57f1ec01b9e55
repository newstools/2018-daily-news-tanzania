The decision to resume its donation to the local government was reached after the Swedish NGO was satisfied with the way the recipients spent money earlier disbursed to the Council alongside other funds it received from the central government. A representative of the Swedish NGO in Mkalama District in Singida region, Reverend Bahati Kito said HumanBridge had previously donated funds to the Council but soon stopped due to misappropriation of funds. “…previously Human- Bridge donated substantial financial aid but due to lack of close supervision which led to misappropriation of funds, the NGO withdrew its support … and completely ceased to give any money,” Rev, Kito said. He added; “… now that the country is being run by President John Magufuli, who has clearly proved to be alert on proper management of the country’s resources, we are forced to resume providing assistance.” The cleric Kito said following proper spending of its funds the Swedish NGO has pledged to extend its financial assistance to other sectors such as education, infrastructure and water supply. On his part, Mkalama District Commissioner (DC), Eng Jackson Masaka said he was grateful for the ‘generous’ support, saying he would ensure that all medical supplies were distributed to all dispensaries and health centres in the area and that authorities would take proper care of the stocks so they could last longer for the benefit of future generation. Initially, Mkalama district council had allocated 950m/-- for the construction of a health centre at Msiu area, and was also committed to overall service improvement at Mkalama and Kinyangiri health centres during FY 2018/2019
