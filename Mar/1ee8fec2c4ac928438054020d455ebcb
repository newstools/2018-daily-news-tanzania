The village has suffered a series of armed robberies since the inception of small-scale gold mines at Mpinga and later Nholi villages in 2016. The villagers told Bahi District Commissioner (DC), Ms Elizabeth Kitundu they had since raised 10m/- to finance their own security measures. Initially, Nholi goldmine Manager, Mr Kulwa Limbu said they had made requests to authorities at the District and Regional Offices only to get a 92m/- bill and a structural design from the region police head office. “The villagers cannot afford this bill … it’s too much for villagers to pay … we can raise at least 10m/-,” he said, explaining that the villagers need the police station to beef up security. The Nholi goldmine has around 100 licenced small-scale miners, according to details available at the office of the regional mineral officer. The new mine contributed some 250m/- last year in government royalty fees and taxes. DC Ms Kitundu said, however, that her office had since requested the regional office to review the structural designs to ensure the cost does not become a burden to the taxpayers. “The plan was for the region police to set up a standard police post that can also house firearms,” she said. “Such police post needs a different designs to ensure it’s fully equipped and stable to handle any violence …especially at the mining site.” She acknowledged that the regional office is now working on the document and would soon release a new design ready for the construction of the police post at the village. The DC, however, called on the villagers to get ready for the nationwide National Identification exercise currently being implemented in Bahi urban, saying it would soon be implemented at Chipanga -- followed by Mwitikila ward.
