New Manager for Park Hyatt Zanzibar Hotel, Nicolas Cedro said in Dar es Salaam yesterday that all food products that meet quality standards are sourced within to benefit the domestic producers and cater for the increased number of tourists in the Isles. “We work with the local business communities in sourcing most food products used in our hotel as way to empower the societies in the island to benefit from the tourism industry,” he said, adding that only few food products that are now available in the country are sourced from outside. Mr Cedro said there are 33 Park Hyatt hotels spread in different parts of the world which fall under the Hyatt international. He said Zanzibar will continue to register strong tourism industry due to increased number of direct flights to the Isles as well as the improvement in the business environment. He said Zanzibar have the most attractive heritage tourism attractions in the world that attract tourists from Europe and America as well as some Asian countries with the growing number of tourists currently coming from some East African Countries. He said 50 per cent of tourists come from Europe and United Arab Emirates and the remaining 50 per cent are from Africa particularly the East Africa countries with Kenya leading in the list. Zanzibar is now eying to attract tourists from Russia, China, and Middle East countries because for years it has been relying on those western countries, European countries and the United States. At least 80 per cent foreign currencies come from the tourism sector that contributes 20 per cent to Zanzibar’s GDP and recorded 376,000 in the 2016/2017 fiscal year from 162,242 recorded in the previous year. The Isles is targeting 500, 000 tourists by 2020.
