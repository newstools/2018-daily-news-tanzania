BERNARD Goosen from South Africa was the first person to scale to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro on a wheelchair. This was an extraordinary feat, but the next achievement will blow up your mind. KYLE Maynard, who had no legs and arms, became an inspiration for millions, when in 2012; he crawled up to the highest peak of Mount Kilimanjaro without any prosthetics or help. HAVE you ever seen a lion climbing trees? May be on Televisio. Well, what you saw was a shot from the Lake Manyara National Park; the home to worldâ€™s only tree climbing lions, but not Ruaha National Park, where we also have a home to largest population of wild elephants very rare in all of Eastern Africa countries. ZANZIBAR has its own leopard population. Known as the Zanzibar Leopard (Panthera pardus adersi), they are endemic to the island and are assumed by some authorities to be extinct or very nearly so. MOUNT Kilimanjaro is a world in itself, with a staggering five different types of climatic zones, from hot tropical forests to arid snowcapped peaks. In comparison, the whole of the US has a total of 7 climatic zones.
