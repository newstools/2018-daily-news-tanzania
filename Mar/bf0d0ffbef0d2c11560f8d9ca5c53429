“We’re also holding the lorry driver, one Aloyce Mvungi (34) of Pasua in Moshi and his assistant Emmanuel Sambara (39) of Majengo in Moshi for transporting the illegal immigrants,” said the RPC. Mr Muroto noted that preliminary investigations showed that the illegal immigrants were received by Mvungi at Holili border ofTanzania and Kenya and that the suspect had to transport them to Mbeya Region. He said the suspects used boxes to hide the illegal immigrants in the lorry bearing registration number T 756 BMY make of Mitsubishi Fuso Tandam, saying Police found the suspect with money amounting to 5.4m/-. “The money was to be used for bribing police officers on the way. The suspects attempted in vain to bribe police officers,” said Mr Muroto. Last week, two illegal immigrants from Rwanda were arrested after they were being found being transported in a lorry at Mtera Police Check Point in Mpwapwa District, Dodoma Region. Dodoma Regional Police Commander (RPC), Gilles Muroto, told a press conference here last Friday that the two illegal immigrants were on transit to Zambia in a lorry bearing registration number T442 CVK driven by one Beda Sanga (32) of Iringa. “We have arrested two illegal immigrants, lorry driver and impounded a vehicle which was being used to transport them,” said the RPC. Mr Muroto mentioned the illegal immigrants as Angelina Umotoni (26) and Uwamalia Solange (23) both residents of Kigali in Rwanda. He said police were still investigating the matter to establish the owner of the lorry which was used to transport the illegal immigrants, urging drivers to refuse transporting illegal immigrants because it is against the law
