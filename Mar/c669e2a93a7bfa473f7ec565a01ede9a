The construction of the health center started since 2008 through the efforts of residents of Lubanda ward who organized themselves and begun the construction and to date two buildings are about to be completed. Speaking during her one day visit to inspect health activities in the district, Minister Mwalimu said that the idea by Lubanda residents to begin the construction of the health facility is a way to demonstrate that they can bring their own development. She said in recognizing their efforts, the fifth phase government under President John Magufuli has allocated 720 million shilling for the construction of the center, and already 500 million shillings has been deposited into the Ileje district council account. “You started the construction in 2008, but in just two years of his presidency, Dr Magufuli has allocated 720 million and 500 million has already been deposited in the council account, the President’s intention is to bring development to the people and we will support him by working hard” she said.
