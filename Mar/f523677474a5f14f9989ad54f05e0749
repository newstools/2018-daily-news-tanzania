MSD Director General, Mr Laurean Bwanakunu told reporters in Dar es Salaam that the pack will be available in all public hospitals and MSD community outlets at 21,000/-. “Childbirth is a complex process and it is essential to remember to provide everything that is needed to ensure both mother and newborn child receive the safest care possible, we believe the pack is sold at affordable price,” he noted. Mr Bwanakunu urged wellwishers who want to support women in the country, especially those in rural areas, to send their request at the store to procure the lifesaving pack. He also invited health facilities in the country to send their requests. The DG also urged those who will procure the pack to make sure they send them to dispensaries or health centres instead of putting them in their private shops.
