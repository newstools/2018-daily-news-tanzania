The appeal is contained in a speech made at the closing session of the ninth camp for children and youth living with HIV, held in Moshi, Kilimanjaro region, over the weekend. Speaking on behalf of 50 participants from Geita, Mwanza and Tanga regions, one of the children living with HIV/Aids, Ms Agnes Gabriel said the camp in Moshi had raised renewed hope for their future lives. “We were taught, among other things, to have self-confidence, how to assess ourselves in our daily performance, how to cope with our medication and other health issues in general. “We congratulate the Ariel Glaser Pediatric AIDS Healthcare Initiative (AGPAHI) for organising this camp… we appeal to the government to continue working with AGPAHI and other stakeholders who share the same goals as those of AGPAHI,” she said. Speaking during the same occasion, the Kilimanjaro Regional Medical Officer (RMO), Dr Best Magoma, congratulated AGPAHI for organising the camp, describing the decision as “a good example to reckon with.” “I am made to understand that the participants of this camp were treated to good ‘couching’ on health issues including psychological services … this is a commendable job because when children get good psychological services they will have hope in their future lives,” he said. Earlier, the AGPAHI Communications Manager, Ms Jane Shuma said the organisation had already established 132 children clubs which had a total of 5,123 members.
