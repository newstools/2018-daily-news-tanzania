The Director of Information Services, Dr Hassan Abbas told a press conference here yesterday that the world’s fourth largest shipbuilder ‘STX’ had since signed a building contract with the state firm, Marine Service Company Limited (MSCL). “A contract has already been signed, and the company will soon start construction work,” he told reporters. The ‘Daily News’ could not independently verify the exact date, but initial information released by the government says the project was planned to start anytime from January this year. The new ship is projected to have the capacity to carry 1,200 passengers and ferry at least 400 tonnes of cargo. Dr Abbas says “It is the government commitment to address challenges facing its people. The state promised the ship in three lakes-- Victoria, Tanganyika and Nyasa.” According to the Chief government spokesperson plans were all going on well to meet the state commitment. He said in addition to the new ship, the government is also repairing more existing ships to easy transport in the Lakes. The new ship to be constructed by the South Korean firm is set to last for 24 months and it is a full-government funded project, Dr Abbas said. He went on to note that the government is equally working on improving transport system in the Lake Tanganyika having commissioned process for the construction of a 600 passenger and 400 tonnes new ship. Dr Abbas said a tender to the effect will be announced this month. “Like I said, all these projects will be completed in two years and are fully funded by the government.”
