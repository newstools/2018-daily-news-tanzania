The institution that is not swayed by any form of ideology or corruption to favour any country, is strict to the letter and implements its goals according to rules it sets, hence, when one hears a developing country like Tanzania being extolled by the organisation, the country, obviously deserves a pat on the bank. Kudos Tanzania. Compromising two institutions: the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), and the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank in its poverty reduction, according to its Articles of Agreement, where all its decisions must be guided by a commitment to the promotion of foreign investment and international trade and to the facilitation of capital investment, must have keenly observed how Tanzania is performing and committed to fighting poverty especially in its industrailisation drive and that earned it recognition and appreciation that it is in the right track. Going by the observation made by its Group’s Macroeconomics, Trade & Investment Global Practice (MTI), Senior Director, Dr Felipe Jaramillo while paying a visit to the Minister for Finance and Planning, Dr Philip Mpango recently, Tanzania government has recorded good performance in improving its economy, and deserves praise. In a nutshell, he must have observed many positive contributions of the Fifth Phase Government in its drive to create jobs to the citizens and build up the economy, besides increasing revenue collection through tax collections, because the government does not involve itself in any trade of buying and selling goods. This points out that the government has put its citizens’ welfare as its first priority and invests whatever it collects in various development projects to raise education, and health among others in the public. It should be recognised that the World Bank can not recognise and pump its funds (money) to a corrupt government, that is why it is commending the government of Tanzania for staging war against corruption and ensuring that there is proper use of public fund(s) to increase efficiency in public service. Hence, when Dr Jaramillo advised the government to further invest more in human resource and infrastructure in order to face the world competition and build up progressive economy, it means Tanzania is in its good books.
