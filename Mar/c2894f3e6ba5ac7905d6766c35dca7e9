The Acting Mpanda Municipal Executive Director (MED), Mr Samson Meda revealed this during a special councillors meeting held on Thursday here in the municipality. Expounding further, the acting MED said that all 18 civil servants were required to pursue further studies in quest to meet academic qualifications, but all of them failed to meet the set time frame. “All 18 civil servants were given ample time to pursue further studies in efforts to maintain their posts, some of them are village executive officials as well as executive ward officials. Subsequently, municipal councillors reached such decision of suspending their employment contracts,” he said. According to him, the municipal is already set to recruit and employ other civil servants to fill the vacancies.
