Tourism warden for Tarangire National Park, Dorothy Aloyce told members of TAGCO meeting that tourism is all about promotion and that as media experts they have a great opportunity to support the sector. “You are in good position to promote tourism in the country, we can increase the number of tourists in the country through promotions,” said the TANAPA warden. According to the warden, TANAPA understands the various challenges that face local tourists and that her office encourages people to assist others who wish to visit national parks. “TANAPA understands the challenges that face wananchi, we understand that economic constraints is one of the main challenges, however, we encourage people who can sponsor others to do so and TANAPA will help by discounting some of the costs,” said the TANAPA boss
