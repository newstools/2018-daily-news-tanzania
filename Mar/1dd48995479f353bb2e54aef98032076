Speaking during a field visit at Igogo village in Nanga Ward, Igunga District, one of the farmers, Mr Emmanuel Minoja, said despite attack from pests and diseases, WEMA 2109 has managed to overcome the challenges compared to traditional seeds. He said that on one acre of hybrid maize seeds, farmers expect to harvest over 15 sacks compared to traditional seeds, where they used to harvest between seven and eight sacks of maize. “We thank the government and Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology (OFAB) under COSTECH for their commitment in ensuring farmers learn and apply modern technology in farming,” he said. An extension officer from Nanga ward, Mr Ambele Patric, said that pests affected crops especially maize to a large extent, saying hybrid maize seeds will address the challenges if regulations will be considered. George Bahati, a farmer from Igogo village in Igunga District, asked the government to make available the hybrid maize seeds to all farmers in the village. Director of Social Sciences from the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH), Dr Joyce Nyoni, said the main aim of COSTECH is to ensure science and technology is applicable to Tanzanians.
