Former Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda, speaking at Lushoto-based Kifungilo Seminary Secondary School’s 21st graduation ceremony over the weekend, said it’s high time the government revised the current syllabuses in secondary schools and higher learning institutions. The amendment, he said, will enable students to acquire appropriate skills and knowledge that they will use to easily get employment upon graduation. Mr Pinda noted that the government has to review the employment model for graduate students, saying majority of them nowadays are jobless. “We send our children to schools but after graduation many of them come back on the streets, jobless...we hope the government under President John Magufuli whose focus is industrial economy, will ease the unemployment problem. But, the question is how could they get jobs without the suitable skills that the industrialists require,” queried the retired premier. He said in designing the curriculum, it’s better for the designers to target specific areas that go with the country’s policy and if possible formulate employment and technical curriculums rather than teaching arts subjects that produce linguistic and dialogue experts. Mr Pinda urged parents and guardians to change their mindsets and direct their children to technical and information and communication technology (ICT) subjects, which are key to economic development, globally. Mr Pinda mobilised gathering to collect over 28m/- in fund raising, for construction of a two-storey building, which will upon completion accommodate at least 14 families of teachers.
