The US pledge was given at the just ended EAC Regional Learning Event and Investors Forum/Donors Roundtable on Environment and Natural Resources Management here. At the event that the EAC Secretariat organised in collaboration with Lake Victoria Basin Commission (LVBC) and United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the US said its focus is on sustainable management of the region’s rich natural resources as a driver of socioeconomic growth and sustainable development. USAID Kenya and East Africa Deputy Chief Brad Arsenault said the US government, through USAID, focuses on sustainable management of the region’s rich natural resources as a driver for socioeconomic growth and sustainable development. “Our joint commitment to managing natural resources is critical,” said Mr Arsenault, assuring that USAID is committed to support the EAC strong strategic leadership and maintain collaborative managementstructures to ensure the management and conservation of trans-boundary natural resources. The forum under the theme, ‘Building Resilience in East Africa: Bridging the Gaps in Policy & Practice,’ showcased the EAC’s regional priority programmes in environment and natural resources management, including climate change adaptation, biodiversity conservation, water, sanitation and hygiene as well as trans-boundary water resources management. The meeting brought together regional and national practitioners, policy makers, researchers, non-governmental organisations, international organisations, regional intergovernmental organisations, private sector representatives and development partners from the EAC region. Participants deliberated all topics with the objective of stimulating concrete and practical actions that will impact on the most vulnerable ecosystems and societies. Addressing the forum, EAC Secretary General Ambassador Liberat Mfumukeko commended the fundamental support from USAID towards different sectors, including trade and investment, agriculture, energy, health and institutional strengthening. He said EAC has for the last five years been collaborating with USAID through different projects and programmes, including the Planning for Resilience in East Africa through Policy, Adaptation, Research and Economic Development (PREPARED). “I wish to emphasise that sustainability and scaling up of PREPARED achievements is key and one of the reasons we have gathered here today,’’ said Ambassador Mfumukeko
