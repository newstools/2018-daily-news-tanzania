The District Executive Director (DED) of Kilosa, Mr Kessy Mkambala, revealed this on Friday in his report to Morogoro Regional Commissioner (RC), Dr Kebwe Stephen, during his sensitisation tour related to reviving cotton production in the region. According to Mr Mkambala, the intention is to roll out the plan through cultivating of about 3,200 hectares which is equivalent to 8,000 acres in 19 wards of the district. “At least 4,096 farmers have been listed to undertake production in the next season in all the 51 villages … in the end, it’s anticipated that they will arrive at 6,445 acres of cotton,” said Mr Mkambala. He pointed out that production of the cash crop in 2016/2017 farming season was encouraging as 431 hectares were produced as compared to the previous years from 2007 to 2009, where an acre could yield between 220 to 330 Kg instead of 800 Kg to 1000 Kg. The DED further observed that his district intends to set aside a basket fund for encouraging growth of cotton by involving 50 youth and women groups of Muhenda Village which already has in place an area for production. On his part, the Kilosa District Commissioner (DC), Mr Adam Mgoyi, called upon local authorities to establish peace committees that will resolve existing conflicts between herders and farmers in their areas.
