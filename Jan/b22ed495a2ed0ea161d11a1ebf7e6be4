He said extension officers have been posted in the area to support farmers and help them to address various challenges, and that neglecting them is totally unacceptable. Mr Odunga was speaking yesterday during one-day training to agro extension officers on biotechnology in agriculture. The training was organized by Open Forum of Agricultural Biotechnology (OFAB) under Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH) in Chemba district, Dodoma region. He added that in order to ensure extension officers in the region efficiently perform their duties; his office has prepared a special programme by establishing record books for the implementation of agricultural activities in all districts in the region. He said that the books will be used to keep records of all agricultural activities from the village, record daily activities that are performed by extension officers in their areas and keep record of the experts and management team who visit farmers in various villages and wards. Mr Odunga pointed out that some extension officers have not been submitting reports for feeding to the Agriculture Routine Database System (ARDS). He said that the training will help to bring changes to farmers through extension officers in the district. â€œThis training is very important for the development of agricultural issues in the district. This will enhance and improve production of food and increase income since the main source of income in the district is agriculture and livestock
