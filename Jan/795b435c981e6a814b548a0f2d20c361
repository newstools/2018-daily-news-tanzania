This was unveiled yesterday in Dar es Salaam by TBF General Secretary Michael Mwita, who said the appointment of new leaders will help to streamline the federation’s works as each person will be working hard in his or her roles. He also said the TBF Executive Committee will meet soon to discuss various issues that will help to propel the federation to prosperity. “After the general election, the newly elected leaders are determined to do their works diligently for the growth of basketball in the country,” Mwita said. He added that Tanzania is blessed with talented basketball players who only need to be nurtured for them to reach great heights of their careers. “We want to do better in international competitions and restore our glory in this sport,” revealed Mwita. Before the new appointment, Kabinda contested for the secretary general of the federation and was defeated by Mwita, who got 26 votes against six votes gained by his opponent Kabinda. During the election, Amina Ahmed was elected the federation’s Treasurer, while Michael Kadebe will head the Planning Commission. Phares Magesa was elected new TBF president after hauling 23 votes against three votes obtained by his closest challenger, John Bandile, who failed to retain his presidential post of the federation.
