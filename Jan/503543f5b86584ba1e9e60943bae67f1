To that end, he stressed that solid co-operative engagements between the Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) and industrialists were fundamental, for the benefit of both sides. “There is no industrialisation without standardisation; the two are inter-related towards facilitating the production of high-quality products,” Prof Gabriel said. He made the remarks in Dar es Salaam yesterday during a familiarisation tour of TBS since his appointment in October last year. Prof Gabriel also advised the standard regulator to come up with standards which would not be a stumbling block to the national industrial economy drive but their facilitators instead, furthermore underscoring the need for industrialists to work closely with TBS for the betterment of their products, and ultimately, an improved national economy. “You should go for strategic customer care and value chain of your services so that at the end of the day you get proper feedback,” he stressed, urging industrialists to cultivate a tradition for observing standards for sustainable industries. On his part, the TBS Director General, Prof Egid Mubofu, said they were well prepared to address effectively all issues related to standards promotion, towards realising the industrial economy drive dream. He told the Permanent Secretary that they were involving the committee responsible for crafting standards, in response to rising demands of various sectors and markets. “We have surpassed the targets as far as standards are concerned and it is clear that the industrial drive is on the right track, going by the consistently rising number of industrialists who are applying for licences and standards marks,” Prof Mubofu noted
