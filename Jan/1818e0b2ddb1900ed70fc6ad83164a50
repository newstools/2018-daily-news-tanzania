Mr Kijuu made the call on the occasion to mark the 54th anniversary of the Zanzibar Revolution. “As we celebrate the occasion, we must ensure that the prevailing peace and unity is maintained at all costs. Religion and political differences should not be allowed to divide us,” he said. Mr Kijuu, has in the meantime advised farmers in the region to commercialize through modern bee keeping and honey harvesting. He noted that modern bee keeping and honey harvesting would add their income following an outbreak of the Banana Xanthomonas Wilt (BXW), also known as Banana Bacterial Wilt (BBW). The Coffee Rust disease has also caused panic among farmers. Mr Kijuu noted that the region had potential and a conducive weather climate to benefit from modern bee keeping and honey harvesting, saying that people should change their mind-set and move with time, adding that there is no reason at all to complain without taking any action. He said that bee keeping is a lucrative business to pull people from poverty. A farmer can pocket between 200,000/- - 250,000/- from a well-managed bee hive. He elaborated that 672 farmers engaged in active bee keeping, out of which 420 were males and 252 women while the number of bee hives increased from 151,860 during 2005/2006 to 212, 250 during 2010/2011, equivalent to 13.8 per cent increase
