That was revealed by the Rukwa Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr Joachim Wangabo, shortly after visiting a small scale farm field of coffee grown at Katuka Village in Kalambo District recently. Score of small-scale coffee farmers at Katuka Village told the RC that some of them have formed groups meant to continue growing coffee though in small scale. “In the past this cash crop was grown in Sumbawanga District, Nkasi and Kalambo but lack of reliable markets made farmers to shift to maize cultivation,” he said. He said it was now imperative to revive coffee cultivation by establishing Rukwa Cooperative Union for coffee farmers. “Farmers should not hesitate to seriously embark on growing coffee to their precincts … but don’t quote me wrong. I don’t mean that you (famers) to stop cultivating maize. No but I can assure you that coffee is one of the profitable cash crops whose market is reliable and competitive locally and oversees,” he added. Sumbawanga District Commissioner (DC), Dr Halfan Haule, said the soil and climate of most part of Rukwa Region was similar to that in the coffee growing regions of Mbeya and Songwe. He encouraged farmers to start cultivating coffee in their precincts as after three years they will start harvesting throughout their lives. Acting Agriculture Officer from the Rukwa Regional Secretaries, Mr Ocran Chengula, said in past years coffee was grown at Kate and Mfili villages in Nkasi District, Katuka and Msanzi Villages (Kalambo) and Msandamuungano village in Sumbawanga District.
