The nets with holes of measurements under 8 millimetres and packed in more than 1200 bales each with four rolls were discovered inside the Sun-Flag Textile Factory located in Njiro section of Themi Hills, within the Arusha industrial area. It emerged that, in addition to plaiting mosquito repelling bed nets, the factory had illegally installed production lines for special nets ordered by racketeers for netting under-age fish and which also tampered with vegetation. The patrolling officer from the Ministry’s Centre for Fishing Resources Management in Mwanza, Mr West Ndembati, who headed the ministerial committee, said the 50 tonne nets consignment was worth over 300 million/- “Over the weekend the Minister for Livestock and Fisheries, Mr Luhaga Mpina, ordered the destruction of seven tonnes of similar nets that were discovered at the same factory in Arusha and imposed a 100 million/- fine on the Sun-Flag management,” said Mr Ndembati, adding that before leaving, he instructed them to remain behind and monitor goings-on there. He said officials from the ministry had been tipped off by some workers at the factory in Njiro on illegal activities there.
