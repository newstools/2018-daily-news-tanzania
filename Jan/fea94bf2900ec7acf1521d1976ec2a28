“Once surveyed and planned land is a crucial capital to the population and source of revenues to the government,” the Director of Urban and Rural Planning in the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Human Settlements Development, Prof John Lupala, remarked over the weekend. Prof Lupala made the remarks at the end of a two-day land stakeholders’ meeting in Dar es Salaam ahead of the Ninth Edition of The World Urban Forum to be organised by UN-HABITAT in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, next month.

The New Urban Agenda was adopted in October 2016 at the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development – Habitat III in Quito, Ecuador.
