Reviewing the party’s performance during 2017, CHADEMA’s national chairman Freeman Mbowe remarked yesterday that so many issues happened during the year, citing its own fight against corruption. “We believe that the government’s move against criminals is a good thing, but the hearing of the cases facing the accused people needs to be conducted with speed,” Mr Mbowe stated. Mr Mbowe reiterated the old maxim that ‘justice delayed is justice denied’ and said he believed that timely administration of justice was crucial. Meanwhile, he argued that Tanzania would remain a safe place to live in only if Tanzanians continue cherishing the importance of the country’s unity. In line with this, he said, the voice of the religious leaders was equally important in shaping the nation. On future plans, he announced that the year 2018 would provide a good platform for the party’s search for dialogue, rather than clashes with the government in resolving public issues. He said, for instance, that in 2016 the opposition launched UKUTA movement, but later ditched it after realising that it could affect people’s lives. “We will continue seeking dialogue as a way of resolving issues with the government. We will not clash with the government. Our doors are open for dialogue,” he said. Speaking over a wave of its leaders crossing over to the ruling CCM, Mr Mbowe explained that it was a right of a member of the party, but rubbished it merely as “part of politics.’ “In order for a tree to grow, the leafs must drop, this is actually the reality with politics,” he said. And, as yesterday was the deadline for public leaders to declare personal wealth with the Ethics Secretariat, Mbowe told journalists that all leaders within his party, including MPs have taken heed of the directive.
