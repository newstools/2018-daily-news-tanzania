The win gave Taifa a relief following their 1-0 loss to Zimamoto two days earlier. Losers Mlandege, had beaten JKU 2-1 in a match held at the same venue on Friday. Both teams played entertaining football right from the start, but poor finishing was a big problem to the teams. No team managed to score the opener as the first half ended in a barren draw. Both teams are placed in Group B along together Young Africans and Singida United. Mlandege are leading the group with three points, followed by Zimamoto, JKU and Taifa of Jang’ombe There will be three matches at Amaan Stadium. Mlandege will face Zimamoto at 4:00 pm before Taifa of Jang’ombe hosting JKU in the night match. Meanwhile, Zimamoto’s Assistant Coach, Mohamed Tangisho rubbished allegations that his team’s loss to JKU in the Mapinduzi Cup match was not caused by the absence of their key striker, Hamadi Ibrahim Hilika. He said the absence of Hilika who was with Zanzibar Heroes in Pemba didn’t affect much his team hence that should not be taken as a cause of defeat. Tangisho said that in reaction to his team’s 1-0 loss to JKU in Mapinduzi Cup match at Amaan Stadium. He, however, pointed out to fatigue claiming his players didn’t get enough time to rest after beating Taifa of Jang’ombe 2-1 in the match that a number of players picked injuries.
