The Head of State directed the Minister for Agriculture, Dr Charles Tizeba to ensure that fertiliser reaches farmers in all regions rated as major producers of food crops by last Friday. Speaking during separate interviews when they turned up at the Tanzania Fertiliser Company (TFC) to purchase the fertiliser, the residents commended the government for implementing the President’s directive, saying it had given them a new zeal for farming. At State House on Monday, Dr Magufuli said Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa would make a closer follow-up on the matter and authorities defaulting on the directive ‘better resign’. “Farmers need fertiliser and this is the time to get it,” said the President, adding: “It is astonishing to see that funds have been set aside for the purpose, but fertiliser does not reach farmers.” He cited Rukwa as one of the regions on which the country relies heavily for food crops, saying the respective minister was in place, but fertiliser is nowhere to be seen. Bishop Godlove Weston of the Ukombozi ni Mkulima Church in Rukwa Region who is a farmer said initially it was difficult to access fertiliser. “It has been long overdue and we are glad that we can now access fertiliser at a time when we need it for our crops and we are optimistic that we will harvest more,’’ he said. Another farmer from Kate Village, Nkasi District, Julius Kibona said since the President issued the directive, more vehicles were arriving in his district loaded with fertiliser consignments. “The scarcity of fertiliser will now remain history in our district because we are witnessing so many vehicles bringing it,’’ he said.
