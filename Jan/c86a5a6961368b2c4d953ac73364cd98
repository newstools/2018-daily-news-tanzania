“Police service is all about discipline in everything to the people, time and financial discipline, and discipline in using/ handling police properties/equipment,” he said here during his visit to Field Force Unit (FFU) command positions. Mr Sirro asked police personnel to practise discipline, arguing that observing orders and good behaviour is important in achieving individual and the country’s goals in development, “Even your salary, spend it well with your families!” He said their role as police officers includes ensuring safety of the people and their properties, but that they have to restore total discipline during their duties, except on criminals who may require a special way of handling them. The IGP’s comments come after happenings in the service suggest that discipline in the forces, including handling of properties and finance, were still a problem that must be addressed. “Our aim is to see that police officers are well trained and apply the skills as per expectation of people in the country,” Mr Sirro said as he promised to give six police vehicles, including a small ambulance to the forces in Zanzibar. Sirro’s short inspection tour to Zanzibar was also an opportunity for the forces to pass to him their grievances and challenges, which include insufficient working allowances, asking the IGP to resolve this to improve police services. They complained that low imprest hinders their operations, which includes poor maintenance of vehicles and enough money to purchase fuel, which compelled the police boss to promise action
