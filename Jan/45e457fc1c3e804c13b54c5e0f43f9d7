“It is not a hidden fact that Africa is behind the developed countries in terms of swimming activities simply because we lack adequate funding from concerned authorities,” Lawal said. He said swimming is a capital intensive sport that needs heavy investment for it to flourish in every nation, but the continent still lags behind as far as investment in this sport is concerned. “Personally, I believe that government should take the first step towards assisting swimming for other organisations whether private or government owned to follow suit,” said Lawal who is the former Navy Captain of Nigeria. However, Lawal lauded efforts being made by the Tanzania Swimming Association (TSA) for organising various programmes which are all aimed at facilitating the growth of swimming in the country. In his words, Hosea Edward from the Tanzania Scout Association who is taking part in the threeday clinic, said the course will help them understand well different skills which are required in swimming industry. “This is a rare opportunity for us to learn some new skills which are vital as far as swimming is concerned,” Edward said. The clinic which has been sponsored by the IST and Seaclif Hotel and Luxury Apartment, has drawn over 40 participants, and is expected to reach climax tomorrow.
