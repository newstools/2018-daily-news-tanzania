Speaking during the official visits to cotton farmers in Meatu, Maswa and Igunga districts, Mr Edward said that last season (2016/17) there were 130,000 hectares of farmland planted and this year so far there are 600,000 hectares. Mr Edward said the application of agricultural practices which is supported by the adequate supply of seeds UKMO8, insecticides, sprayers and fertilisers have helped farmers to increase the size of their cotton farms. He further said the government is highly committed to seeing to it that all the farmers are benefiting from cotton cultivation. The Igunga District Commissioner (DC), Mr John Mwaipopo, said they have done a great campaign under the Tabora Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr Aggrey Mwanri, on the emphasis of cotton crop plantation. He said Igunga farmers have been responding positively by using modern agricultural practices. He added that there are 53 villages and 17 wards that have planted cotton. Mr Mwaipopo has also called upon various stakeholders to turn up in big numbers in order to build the textile industry during the harvest season. He added that they will continue providing seminars to farmers on the proper harvesting of cotton in order to have good outputs. Mr Mwaipopo said the TCB and government have helped farmers to get pesticides, seeds and sprayers on time. On his side Meatu district cotton inspector, Mr Renatus Filbert said that in their district, the good use of the seeds UKMO8 by farmers in Kisesa, Mwabusalu, Nyaranja and Kimalu wards will help in getting more cotton harvest.
