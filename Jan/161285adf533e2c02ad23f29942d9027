Availing the health center to the residents will, no doubt, bring a sigh of relief to them after years of the absence of reliable health services in the district, a problem that prompted them to present their request to the president last August when he toured the district. Addressing Majengo area residents on Wednesday, Muheza Member of Parliament, Mr Adadi Rajabu said a total of 400m/- was disbursed by the central government to finance the construction of the health facility at Mkuzi area. The construction of the health center will help decongest Muheza District hospital that has always been overwhelmed by patients. The implementation of the project has come four months after President Magufuli made the promise through the Minister for Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, Ummy Mwalimu during the tour. While addressing his voters on Wednesday, Mr Rajabu said the construction of the heath facility will start with a maternity ward and a theater room. He further explained that apart from such amount of money injected in the construction project, the government will also provide another 300,000,000/- that will be spent in the purchase of modern medical equipment. He however elaborated that the district council will construct health centres in several wards with the sole purpose of minimizing congestion of patients in the district hospital
