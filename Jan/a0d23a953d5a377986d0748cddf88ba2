The move will enable Pizza hut customers to make payments through M-Pesa, a new development in mobile payment solution that is expected gradually to replace the cash payment system to a cashless society. The partnership was revealed in Dar es Salaam yesterday after Vodacom and the world fast-food Pizza hut Tanzania partnered in providing customers the payment platform through M-Pesa. Vodacom Tanzania Managing Director, Mr Ian Ferrao, said they were delighted that Pizza Hut had seen value in using ‘Lipa Kwa M-Pesa’ service for their customers. He added that in addition to the many benefits of paying by M-Pesa, Vodacom customers will receive 10 per cent instant money back rewards when they pay at any Pizza Hut branch or delivery bike. Over 2,000 organisations have integrated their payment systems with M-Pesa for collections, disbursement and distribution services. More than 5 million customers have subscribed to M-Pawa with over 4bn/- disbursed in loans every month and 21bn/- retained in deposits. MPesa is integrated with 30 banks in Tanzania. “We are happy because M-Pesa now gives us not only the ability to settle money collected into our bank accounts in real time at no cost, but also pay other registered merchants from the same business wallet without charges,” said Pizza Hut Tanzania CEO, Vikram Desai. The partnership enables Pizza hut customers to pay by M-Pesa across all Pizza Hut Tanzania branches and delivery bikes, reducing the risk and burdens of transacting with cash and harness all the benefits of digital payments that the service brings like better record keeping, removed hassle for change and more.
