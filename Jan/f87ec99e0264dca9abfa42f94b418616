The RC issued the order during the roofing of the ongoing construction of one of the teachers’ office at Mapinduzi Primary School in Kinondoni District, in the city yesterday. He said that his team will not tolerate any person who will invade school yards for his or her own interest, pointing out that legal action will be taken. “Today (yesterday) I have directed the police force to arrest a man who invaded Mapinduzi school yard for investigation. Our aim is to support the education sector by encouraging teachers and motivating them to improve the knowledge of our children,” Mr Makonda said. He added that the initiative to construct 402 teachers’ offices in the city has been ongoing whereby 46 offices out of 100 for phase one have taken shape and will be completed as planned. He called upon various stakeholders to support the initiative in order to improve education. The Head Teacher of Mapinduzi Primary School, Ms Phina Kiocha, said that the school has been facing by a number of challenges including school fence and invasion of school yard. “Mapinduzi primary has no fence leading to criminal incidents and some people are invading the school yard. We ask you (RC Mkonda) to support us in ensuring our school remains safe all the time,” she said. She thanked the fifth phase government under President Magufuli’s efforts in ensuring teachers’ working environment and their infrastructure are improved. Kinondoni Mayor Benjamini Sita said the construction of teachers’ offices in the city will help increase schools’ performance and education sector at large.
