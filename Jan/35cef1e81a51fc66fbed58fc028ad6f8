Mara Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr Adam Malima, confirmed to the ‘Sunday News’ that the Premier is expected here tomorrow in a busy schedule that will last for seven consecutive days. The Premier is expected in the region for the first time since he was appointed to the post in 2015. RC Malima said the PM is also expected to lay a foundation stone on several new development projects in the region, including education, health, agriculture as well as infrastructure. “As we speak, I am heading to Butiama, the hometown of the late founding father Julius Nyerere. The Premier is scheduled to visit the place. He is also expected to address the public in several areas in the region,” he said. He urged the public to turn out in large numbers to welcome him because it’s the second high profile visit to the region after the Vice-President, Ms Samia Suluhu Hassan, visited the region last year. According to the RC, industrialisation is expected to top the agenda of the regional submissions to the Premier during the visit. He said each Tanzanian is encouraged to engage in economic activities, including establishing and reviving industries for economic development. Tarime District Commissioner (DC), Glorious Luoga, said so far the sugar factory, which was launched by the Vice-President last year, is currently recording good performance. He said the establishment of the factory, which has created both direct and indirect employment, reduces illegal cultivation of bhang in the region.
