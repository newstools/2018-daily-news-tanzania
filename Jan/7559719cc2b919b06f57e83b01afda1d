Out of six cross-listed counters, three appreciated while the other three lost value.

Going forward we expect to have the same roller-coaster moves on some counters as what happened to Swissport. On DSE Plc and CRDB counters however,we might continue to experience price upward pressure because volume on the bid-side has been outstripping offers the past few days. Both counters financial year end on 31st December, therefore February and March are the critical months to appraise their performance and decipher possible price direction.
