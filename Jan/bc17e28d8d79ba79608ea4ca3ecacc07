According to police report that was also confirmed by Morogoro Regional Commissioner (RC), Dr Kebwe Stephen Kebwe, one resident was swept away by the raging flood on Mkondoa River in Kilosa District. The RC said the victim, who was not immediately identified, was swept away by the raging river after he attempted to cross it as the rain was pounding the area. The regional boss spoke on the second victim, saying the woman aged 50 years whose name was not immediately identified died after being hit by a falling tree while inside her house. According to the report, the incident occurred in Forkland Street in the Municipality on Thursday as it was raining cats and dogs, accompanied by strong winds. As a result of the rain, Dr Kebwe said, each District Disaster Management Committee would conduct assessment in its own district to establish the level of damage before embarking on measures to rectify the situation. Apart from the deaths that occurred on Thursday, several parts of Morogoro Municipality were inundated, rendering roads impassable after the drainage systems were completely overwhelmed. Last week three people died in Dodoma Municipality, including an artisanal miner who died while underground after the mining site was flooded following downpour. On Monday this week, Dar es Salaam Rapid Trust suspended its services for hours after Jangwani area along Morogoro Road was floode.
