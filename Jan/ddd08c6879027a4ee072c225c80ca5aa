THE National Examination Council of Tanzania (NECTA) has released the 2017 Certificate of Secondary Education Examination (CSEE) and Qualifying Test (QT) results which show that the passing rate has increased by 7.22 per cent from 70.35 percent in 2016 to 77.57 in 2017.The results also indicate that the number of candidates who got between divisions I and III increased to 30.15 per cent. In 2015 the pass mark stood at 25.34 per cent while in 2016 the percentage was 27.60. Announcing the results at a news conference in Dar es Salaam yesterday, the NECTA Executive Secretary, Dr Charles Msonde, said Kiswahili subject topped all the subjects in pass marks while Basic Mathematics was still at the bottom. “Apart from an outstanding increase in pass marks, the recent results show that students still performed poorly in Physics, Basic Mathematics, Commerce and Book-keeping, and thus concerted efforts were still needed to increase the pass rate in all subjects,’’ he said. According to him, Kiswahili led in the list of subjects that had the highest pass mark by 84.42 per cent while Basic Mathematics had the poorest pass mark of 19.19 per cent. Other subjects and their percentages were Civics (58.75), History (55.99), Geography (53.18), English Language (67.86), Physics (42.17), Chemistry (53.39), Biology (61.37), Commerce (46.45) and Book Keeping (40.82). Dr Msonde named the top ten good performing schools as St Francis Girls (Mbeya), Feza Boys (Dar es Salaam), Kemebos (Kagera), Bethel Sabs Girls (Iringa), Anwarite Girls (Kilimanjaro), Marian Girls (Coast), Canossa (Dar es Salaam), Feza Girls (Dar es Salaam), Marian Boys (Coast) and Shamsiye Boys of Dar es Salaam. The results further show ten schools that performed poorly. The schools from the bottom are Kusini (Unguja South), Pwani Mchangani (Unguja North), Mwenge S.M.Z. (Mjini Magharibi), Langoni (Mjini Magharibi), Furaha (Dar es Salaam), Mbesa (Ruvuma), Kabugaro (Kagera), Chokocho (Pemba South), Nyeburu (Dar es Salaam) and Mtule (Unguja South). In yet another bad news, NECTA annulled the results of 265 candidates over cheating incidences, out of which 136 relate to private candidates and 129 to public schools. One candidate, according to Dr Msonde, wrote abusive language on an answer sheet. The NECTA boss said cheating incidences were continuing to increase year after year as candidates were devising new tactics. He added that NECTA had forwarded the names of cheating candidates to the responsible authorities for further actions. Dr Msonde added that the examinations body withheld the results of 50 candidates who encountered health problems during the examinations last year, consequently failing to sit some examinations. The candidates have been given an opportunity to do the examinations that they missed in the next (2018) session. A further 77 candidates didn’t sit all the exams due to sickness; they too, had been availed the option of doing so in the 2018 national examinations
