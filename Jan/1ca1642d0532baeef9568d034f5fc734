The award winning women business leader and CEO of Ibra Contractors Limited, Ms Maida Waziri met and motivated leaders from 14 villages on how to create successful businesses. “The 14 village have come together as ‘Bulyanhulu Community’ in pursuit of self-actualisation for the villagers in taking advantage of economic opportunities in their area for their own good and that of the nation,” she said. The winner of 2017 All Africa Business Leader Awards (AABLA) Entrepreneur of the year-East Africa, recently met leaders from the 14 villages who included village chairpersons, ward and village executives and leaders of saving and credit societies in the area. She said by championing local content in mining, the government has created the right environment for them to create wealth and stop depending on donations. The village leaders had invited her company Ibra Contractors Limited to explore business opportunities in their jurisdiction, which the community can benefit directly and at least 40 of them attended the discussions. The 14 villages are now looking to work with local investors to be able to take advantage of business opportunities presented by Bulyanhulu Gold Mine. The business leader noted that despite the 14 villages having huge mineral resources in the particular land, the villagers were struggling to make ends meet. During the discussions Ms Maida told the leaders that with a change of mindset, where the people should start looking at themselves as wealth creators and not poor people needing help all the time, things would change. “Building wealth is the key for a better future for all the villages and it was paramount for the union created by the 14 villages, to have a village wealth creation fund, which would go a long way to support local enterprise development,” she said.
