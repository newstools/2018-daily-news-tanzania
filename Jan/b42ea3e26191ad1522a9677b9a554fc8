Commissioner General of Immigration Department, Dr Anna Makakala revealed that criteria before while explaining how the e-passport will work and its importance in curbing cross border crimes including terrorism. “Everyone should make sure he/she gets National Identification Card as a requirement to be used to get the new passport,” she insisted. Minister of Home Affairs Dr Mwigulu Nchemba stated that the e-document will be available for 150,000/- and will last for 10 years, an average of 15,000/- per year.
