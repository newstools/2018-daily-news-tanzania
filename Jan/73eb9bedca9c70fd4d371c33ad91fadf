The ministers who inspected the airport yesterday were Natural Resources and Tourism Minister Dr Hamisi Kigwangalla and his Home Affairs counterpart, Mr Mwigulu Nchemba. Works, Transport and Communication Deputy Minister Atashasta Nditiye and Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation Deputy Minister Susan Kolimba also represented their dockets. Briefing journalists, Dr Kigwangalla said since August last year, they embarked on efforts to speed up service provision at the facility. “During our visit for the second time today, we have noticed some improvements, one being the reduction of time spent on serving foreign travellers from three hours to only one hour,” he explained.
