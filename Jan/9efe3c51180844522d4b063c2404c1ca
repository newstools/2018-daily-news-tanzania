This was confirmed to the ‘Daily News’ yesterday by JMK Youth Park Football Academy Manager, Edu Tamayo, who said preparations for the upcoming trials are unfolding well. “The aim of the trials is to select ten new crop of players to join the academy as we thrive to assist the government in efforts to uplift football standards from the foundation level,” Tamayo said. He further narrated that they are looking for young players, who are energetic, ready to learn and understand the game of football. He said the players should have great footwork, ball passing and ball control skills as well as having great sense of teamwork, capable to work in unity with their colleagues on and outside the pitch. “Football is played on the ground but there are some skills which can be learnt from the classroom, that is why here at JKM Youth Park, we also run classroom lessons for the players,” he said. He also said once players have been admitted to join the academy, they will play there for one year while undergoing assessment every three months as one way of ensuring that their potential and stamina is improving. According to the manager and available fixture, on Saturday, the trials will begin from 8am up to noon and will be done by boys who were born in 2001. Thereafter in the afternoon, it will be the turn of boys who were born in 2002 as they will showcase their footwork skills from 2pm to 6pm.
