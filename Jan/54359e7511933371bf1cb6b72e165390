Through their Peoples’ Empowerment Foundation (PEF), it donated 108 artificial limbs to some Dar es Salaam residents at the weekend during a brief event. Speaking during the event, the Kamal Group chairman, Mr Gagan Gupta said the donation was based on its philosophy of growing with the community that the company launched the initiative of helping the people with disabilities three years ago. “We have set up a special unit that manufactures these artificial limbs at Kamal Steel as a way of cutting costs associated with the making of the products….We are doing this for the third year and we will continue doing so,” he said, thanking the Dar es Salaam Regional Commissioner (RC), Mr Paul Makonda for bringing the disabled people together so they could get the limbs. The Deputy Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office (Policy, Parliamentary Affairs, Labour, Employment, Youth and the Disabled), Mr Anthony Mavunde who graced the event acknowledged the wonderful contribution of PEF and Kamal Group to Tanzania’s social economic development and urged other companies to emulate. “Through this Kamal Group is showing us that it is a good corporate citizen. If every company can emulate this, we in government will be happy with them. This will then give us an impetus to further improve the business climate,” he said. He said the government would meet with Kamal Group officials with a view to designing the best way to ensure that the artificial limb project reaches all the needy Tanzanians across the country. Available data at least 3.6 million Tanzanians have various forms of disabilities. Out of the number, some 1.7 million have disabled parts, including limbs and arms among others. However, data from the Tanzania Association of the Disabled, show that it is only about 20 per cent who can actually get access to artificial body parts such as limbs.
