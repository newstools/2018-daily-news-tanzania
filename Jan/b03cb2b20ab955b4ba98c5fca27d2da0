BBC quoted White House Doctor Ronny Jackson as saying, “I have no concerns about his cognitive ability or neurological functions. " President Trump, 71, had a three-hour medical check-up, few days after the release of a controversial book about the US Head of State’s mental health. Dr Jackson revealed to reporters that Donald Trump overall health was “excellent.” "All data indicates the president is healthy and will remain so for the duration of his presidency," BBC quoted the White House doctor. However, Dr Jackson said that Mr Trump could benefit from a lower-fat diet and more exercise.
