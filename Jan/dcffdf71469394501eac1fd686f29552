Mr Biteko issued the directive here during his first visit to the Dodoma-based institute on Monday evening, saying the machines, which were donated by one of the donor countries six months ago, should be installed to enable students to carry out practical training. “I’ve been disappointed by your performance. I don’t want to see the same situation when I come back here,” said the Deputy Minister during his familiarisation tour to institutions under the minerals portfolio. Mr Biteko said MRI should also come up with strategies to promote local experts in mining sector, pointing out that the public institute can recommend at least two graduates for employment when the government issues mining licences to new mining firms. Earlier while briefing the Deputy Minister, the MRI acting Principal, Mr Vincent Pazzia, pointed out that the shortage of teachers in Environmental Engineering and Management in Mines , Oil and Gas Science programme as well as cross cutting subjects was posing a challenge to MRI. He mentioned other challenges that afflict MRI as shortage of lecture theatres, conference halls and staff rooms. Mr Pazzia said MRI was determined to conduct a number of research projects in order to create new sources of earnings to address challenges facing the institute. He said that saying presently MRI in collaboration with Francebased Montpelier University was conducting a research project. “The two-year project is being conducted at Ngorongoro, Lake Natron and Mount Meru in Arusha region,” he added. Mr Pazzia noted that MRI had registered achievements in offering short courses to mining workers during the 2017/2018 fiscal year and that the institute had entered a oneyear agreement with Acacia North Mara to offer training to its workers in mineral processing.
