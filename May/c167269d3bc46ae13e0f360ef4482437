Deputy Minister Dr Faustine Ndugulile told the House that the government has also ordered ambulances that will be distributed amongst the hospitals facing shortage of the facilities. The deputy minister was responding to a question by Special Seats MP, Lukago Midimu (CCM), who had highlighted that Itilima and Busega districts face shortage of health facilities and that the ongoing construction does not meet the demand to improve health service delivery in the area. “Currently, the construction is centred on Outpatient Department (OPD). The district faces shortage of maternal ward and yet there is no ambulance to help patients in case of emergency,” she said. Josephat Kandege, Deputy Minister in the Office of the President (Regional Administration and Local Governments), explained that there was a serious shortage of health centres in Itilima and Busega districts which have a population of over half a million people. The deputy minister said up to now Itilima has three health centres and 27 dispensaries while Busega has only four health centres and 18 dispensaries. “We are working with Canada and UNFPA to improve health service provision and delivery . At least 1.2bn/- has been allocated to improve infrastructures in the districts,” he told the National Assembly. He further added that some 525 m/- was allocated for Ikindilo health centre infrastructure and 450 m/- for Nasa Health centre in Itilima and Busega respectively. “We also allocated 240 m/- to improve infrastructure in eight dispensaries where each will get 30 m/-,” he said. He announced that during the Financial Year 2018/19, the government has allocated 1.5bn/- for the two districts to improve health infrastructures.
