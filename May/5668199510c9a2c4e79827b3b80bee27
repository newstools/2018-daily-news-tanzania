Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB) Regional Chief Joseph Mwaiswelo told reporters here yesterday that a recent follow-up revealed that some of the projects which cost millions of tax payers’ money were delayed because wananchi were not involved in the implementation process of the projects. “This is a serious setback... leaders must rectify the anomaly by sensitising people on the importance to enable them to have ownership and have value for money of the projects,” Mr Mwaiswelo. He underscored the need to work harder and in unity. “Our sole responsibility is to bring development to the people we lead. It is important we understand that the projects are for the citizens and not the leaders,” he emphasised. Mr Mwaiswelo elaborated that between July 1, last year and March 31, 2018 about 23 projects worth 6.818bn/- in various sectors including health, water, education and infrastructure were closely monitored. During the same period, 378 complaints were received by PCCB while 26 cases were still pending in court. Giving the breakdown of received complaints, Mr Mwaiswelo said the judiciary had 115 complaints, police (87), education (75), lands (68) and the health sector (33). Meanwhile, Mr Mwaiswelo has cautioned parents and guardians to be careful before registering their children at schools to avoid cheating. This follows reports indicating that some of the schools offering nursery, primary and secondary education were not registered. “Parents must be extra careful and cross-check with relevant authorities before registering their children. Some of the schools offering nursery education were operating illegally, with some of them not being registered by the National Council for Technical Education (NACTE), he said.
