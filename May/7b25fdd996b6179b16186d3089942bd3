The Marketing Manager for Ubongo Learning, Iman Lipumba, said in Dar es Salaam yesterday that equipping youth with skills, knowledge and resources can increase their competitiveness in the labour market. “With skills, knowledge and resources youth can enter into meaningful and sustainable employment or entrepreneurship that has sustainable income-generating potential,” she said in the youth event organised by Ubongo Learning, a non-profit organisation. The event was centred on research and findings concerning youth employability and economic empowerment, especially for adolescent girls who are more likely to be negatively affected by future changes in the job market than boys. “The goal of the project which is funded by Data for Local Impact (DLI) is to educate youth, especially adolescent girls and young women on how to use easily accessible data to make informed decisions about their future, especially through key financial literacy skills,” she said
