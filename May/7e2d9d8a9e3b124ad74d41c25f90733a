TACAIDS Director of Finance and Administration Yassin Abbas made the remarks during a three-day working meeting, which was attended by AIDS Coordinators and their Assistants from 30 council authorities countrywide at VETA hall here. In his paper, “Financial gaps for HIV and AIDS intervention and Government initiatives”, Mr Abbas observed that while donor resources were becoming scarce day by day, there was need for the nation to reduce excessive dependency on donors and instead public and private sectors be involved fully in combating the disease. “According to the third National Strategic Aids programme 2013/2014 - 2017/2018, the country’s monetary demand for the implementation of the five-year project is six trillion,” he said. He added: “It is estimated that over 93 per cent of the annual budget will come from foreign development partners. So, there is more need now than ever for our public and private sectors to increase financial strength to sustain the project without much dependence on foreign countries.” Commenting on the matter some of the coordinators noted that many of the Council Authorities were indeed a stumbling block on HIV/AIDS fight as they do not set aside any specific budget for the wide spread disease in their areas; instead they were more concerned with other infrastructures and social activities.
