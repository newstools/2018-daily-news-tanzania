The Acting PCCB who is the Regional Chief Bureau, Mr Asajile Siso, made the revelation here yesterday that in January – March 2018 - reports: “We are closely following the fund expenditure on development projects through the Public Expenditure Trucking Survey to uncover if there was mismanagement of allocated funds or if the value for money reflect the work being seen.” He said once they are through with their investigations and there is any foul play action would be taken including taking legal actions against the culprits. Mr Siso hinted that the government had allocated 3,398,405,424/- for the construction of development projects he named as Laela Water Project, where 1,893,496,725/- was pumped in. He further said that during their probe, his institution uncovered that more than 1.8bn/- was spent on the Laela Water Project, whose construction also stalled as a result of unknown circumstances, despite it being categorised as an accomplished work. “Despite the fact that 1,893,496,725 has been spent on the Laela Water Project, yet all the 34 water points were not fixed with meters, nine water point went dry and seven water points have been fixed with only one tap instead of each bearing its own,” he pointed out. He further noted that in the project, about 40 Solar Batteries have gone missing, though upon professional completion, it will serve about 21,068 residents. Laela Water Project was officially launched in November 2015 and was categorised as being completed in 2016
