Addressing the ministry workers’ council meeting here yesterday, Ms Mabula, said her staff should understand that corruption was an enemy of justice and whoever indulgence in it generally tarnishes the image of the government. She hinted that the public generally have a lot of trust in the industry and directed that every public servant should be a watchdog against any misbehaviour to guard their integrity in business. “ We will fail to administer justice if we receive bribe. I thus order every public servant to be a guard at work to prevent such cases. I encourage you to undertake action to report any person being involved in corruption to enhance trust between the people and the government,” added the Deputy Minister. Ms Mabula observed that it was high time every public servant conducted him/herself in high esteem and personally evaluate oneself in order to establish shortcomings likely to occur in the ministry and improve social services in the public.
