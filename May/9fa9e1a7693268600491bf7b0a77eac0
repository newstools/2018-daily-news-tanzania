He said this on Thursday at the State House during the swearing in of Alfayo Kidata who is the new Tanzanian Ambassador to Canada and Cuba. The President said that he had previously directed all the country's envoys to report over their work, indicating successes and challenges they face, but up to now, none of them has filled any report. "What is the benefit of your appointment to Tanzanians?" "Some (ambassadors) will have to come back home and do what they are good at doing than doing nothing tangible to meet Tanzanians’ expectations. It isn’t right that you attend all of unnecessary recreational events abroad while your delivery is nowhere to be traced," insisted President Magufuli and added that the Permanent Secretary and Deputy Minister in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation must work closely to receive and work on reports from the envoys. Ambassador Alfayo Kidata promised to work hard to realize the country's endeavor of becoming a middle economy come year 2025. He promised to persuade more investors on opportunities available in Tanzania so that they can come and invest. Kidata also noted that he will make sure to look for markets for Tanzania’s products as available statistics on balance of trade shows that the country is importing more than exporting. The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation, Dr Susan Kolimba directed the new ambassador to promote available tourism attractions so that more tourists can visit the country to maximize foreign earnings. "Use various platforms, national and international special events in Canada and Cuba to promote tourist attractions," Said Kolimba and added, motivate Tanzanians in Diaspora to use their opportunities for the country's development.
