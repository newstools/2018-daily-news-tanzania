The Deputy Minister told members of parliament that the government is committed to ensure it improves access to agro inputs and help farmers fully utilise the available rains for production. “This is the government commitment, and I confirm that no single farmer will report delay in receiving agro inputs,” she said while responding to a question from Nkasi MP, Ally Mohamed Keissy (CCM). The MP along with other lawmakers took the government to task on how ready it is to help farmers obtain the inputs needed for their productivity on time. Special Seats MP, MrAisha-rose Matembe (CCM) added that the inputs, apart from coming late, were also substandard. She said farmers in Singida for instance, face double crisis, buying inputs which are overpriced and not genuine. But, the MP for Busega (CCM), Dr Raphael Msunga Chegeni said across the country, farmers are reporting invasive insects including Far Arm Worm and Cassava Hornworm attacking crops, forcing majority of farmers into poverty and raise the bar of food shortage. He wanted to know the government plan to curb the worms that have been declared a threat not only to the farmers but the country’s economy. “FAW were first reported in Tanzania in 2017,” the Minister for Agriculture, Dr Charles Tizeba said. He said the government has since the discovery of the invasive worm embarked on public awareness campaigns targeting farmers on detecting and how to fight the parasite. “We have also invested in research to determine the actual pesticide to kill the pest,” he told the National Assembly. Meanwhile, the Deputy Minister, Dr Mwanjelwa said the government has resolved to freeze all subsidies which were being enjoyed by essential crop growers. She said all farmers will sell their crops at a cape price to be adopted by the government
