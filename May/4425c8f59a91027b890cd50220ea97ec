The Executive Director of TASAF, Mr Ladislaus Mwamanga said that during a familiarisation field visit of the delegation from Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) in Dar es Salaam, yesterday. The delegation comprised of an economics Nobel Prize Winner, Prof Joseph Stiglitz, Prof Kaushik Basu and Prof Sabina Alkire all are experts in poverty alleviation. “Implementation of the second phase is anticipated to place big weight on livelihood programmes for the beneficiaries to be able to produce more as a way of accumulating more. It has been witnessed in the first phase of the programme, some poor households receiving cash payments have invested part of the funds in some activities as well as forming savings groups to generate more income,” said Mr Mwamanga. He observed that the plan is to strengthen the groups by helping them to build the capacity and provide subsidies to those groups which will do well.
