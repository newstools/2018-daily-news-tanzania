The move that is aimed at improving efficiency, supervision and interest of union members will also speed up development of cotton farmers in the three giant producers (regions) of the crop in the country. The 23rd general meeting of SHIRECU endorsed the resolution recently in Shinyanga Municipality to allow union members from outside Shinyanga Region to form their own groups in their areas so as to ease management and operations. According to the current arrangements, SHIRECU now becomes an autonomous cooperative union of Shinyanga District, municipality and Kishapu District while Kahama forms Kahama Cooperative Union (KACU) which will serve the interest of Msalala, Ushetu and Kahama. Deputy Registrar of Cooperative Unions, Controller and Management Department, Mr Collins Nyakunga said that the government has proposed unions, to be near to members and government officials, to improve efficiency of operations so as to speed up development. He told the SHIRECU general meeting, which brought together leaders of Agricultural Marketing Cooperative Society (AMCOS) from Shinyanga, Geita and Simiyu regions, that it is the aim of the government to see that there is a strong cooperative union, as it was previously. He told members that all procedures to equally divide shares of the union will be done so that all sides get their shares and utilise towards establishing their unions. The Deputy Registrar of the Cooperative Union in Shinyanga Region, Ms Shoes Monyo, said that the aim of the government is to see every region having its union. She told members of SHIRECU that the government has decided to trust cooperative unions; therefore, it was their turn to support the positive idea of the State to form a cooperative union in every region. The outgoing Chairman of SHIRECU, Mr Robert Mayongela urged members to elect legible leaders who will serve interests of the union, insisting that growth of the union depends on leaders who are honesty and hard working. The SHIRECU General Manager, Mr Nyaruga Lameck, told members of the union that they have managed to recover their building complex in Kurasini and the three houses in Dar es Salaam that had been sold by unscrupulous previous leaders
