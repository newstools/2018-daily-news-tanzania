In line with that, the Commission urged the police force to strengthen and equip the gender and children desk in order to create a user friendly environment for handling cases of children in conflict with the law. Acting Executive Director of the CHRGG Ms Fatma Muya made the call in Dar es Salaam yesterday when officiating at the launch of Inspection Report for the Children in Detention Facilities 2016. She said a survey conducted in 16 regions indicated that most children who were in conflict with the law were still being committed to adult prisons instead of retention homes. The findings revealed that a total of 403 children were retained in the detention facilities and among them 293 were in the prisons with 202 at a pre-trial stage, 64 were convicted and the rest ( 27) were living with their mothers. Ms Muya said that conditions were not suitable for children as in many cases children were placed at risk of abuse from adults, getting insufficient food and lack of medical care whenever required. The Law of the Child Act of 2009 and the International Standards provide for a child who is in conflict with the law to be taken to juvenile courts urgently or to be released on recognizance. The report indicates that currently, there were five juvenile retention homes in Tanzania Upanga, Moshi, Tanga, Arusha and Mbeya. Two facilities in Mwanza and Mtwara were under construction. According to the report, the capacity of the five facilities was to hold 250 children. “At the time of inspection, there were only 64 children in these five retentions,” read part of the report. On the other hand, the report recommended for the establishment and maintenance networks with legal aid providers in order to facilitate access to legal representation to children who are in conflict with the law.
