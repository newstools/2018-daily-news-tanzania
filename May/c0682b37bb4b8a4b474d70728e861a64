Mr Mkuchika made the re-marks before the Parliamentary Network against Corruption (APNAC) when they met with the Construction Sector Transparency Initiative (CoST) to discuss transparency matters in the sector. Mr Mkuchika said such initiatives are key as they assist the government through their projects to see if they cater for value for money in terms of quality and the procurement process. “CoST works with the government, the private sector and civil society to get better value from public infrastructure investment by increasing transparency and accountability, which is something good, for both parties,” he said. Mr Mkuchika insisted on government goodwill to ensure that they work with the private sector in attaining its goals so long as they observe professionalism and ethics in their operations. Presenting the summary of findings for CoST Tanzania 2018 Assurance process, the initiative Chairman, Mr Kazungu Magili, said their finding criteria based on disclosure, assurance and multi-stakeholder working. He said the NSSF Dungu Satellite Village Housing project objectives were not achieved since there were a number of changes compared to what was planned for in the beginning citing an example of replacing a designed police station with the housing unit, thus security matters was not given the needed importance. Moreover, he said, under the same project, the plan to alleviate accommodation deficit in the country was far beyond since, as of December 30, last year, number of units occupied was nil as the rent was not set as well. However, kudos was given to TANROADS for TAZARA Intersection Project as the contractor adhered to international safety and health standards. “Safety for road users and workers has been well managed as up to November 2017, there have been zero accidents while project implementation progress was 74.68 per cent compared to planned 74.61 per cent” said Mr Magili.
