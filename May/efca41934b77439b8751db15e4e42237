It is not an easy opener for our envoys as they are facing a team that outclassed them in their last CAF level tournament in 2016. Union Sportive de la Médina d’Alger, is the official name of the team, and Omar Hamadi Stadium which has a capacity of 12,000 is where our envoys are going to play the hostile hosts. Yanga must fight hard using all tactics to overcome the Algerian club threat, and they must think nothing short of a win despite the fact that they are playing against one of the high ranked teams. They have 18 points in CAF rankings against 2 points which our envoys own. They should not be intimidated by menacing supporters of the team as the records show USM Alger draw an average home attendance of 24,286 for domestic league games; a number regarded as one of the highest in Africa. We are forced to send a word of encouragement to our envoys because the win in the Group Stage opener will give them vital points as the Algerians seem to be toughest in Group D. Yanga should understand that they finished fourth behind TP Mazembe, Mo Bejaia and Mediama in their last appearance. They were off course considered as underdogs, something we wouldn’t want to see this time around. Yes, it is a tough group, but we shouldn’t have mental blocks, otherwise we will defeat ourselves. We should ensure that we collect maximum points in both home and away games. Equally, the players should learn to put in their best. We can say all these things but what matters most is the commitment from the players. I hope these boys can come to the party and realise they are carrying the nation’s banner. With proper team selection and good preparations we can compete. We end up wishing our envoys all success in their tough assignment.
