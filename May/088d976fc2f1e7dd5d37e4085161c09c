The legislators believe the harsh initiative will help in taming the problem for good. For some time now, illegal fishing has impeded the country to benefit from the important resources despite the fact that 346,337 square kilometres, about 37 per cent of the entire Tanzania comprises of water. Speaking at the ministry organised seminar for Members of Parliament (MPs) on the fight against illegal fishing at Pius Msekwa Hall in the parliamentary grounds here, some lawmakers advised the government to take stern measures against all people involved in the scandalous business for the country to benefit from the resource. Kyerwa MP Innocent Bilakwate said most of the things have not been moving in the country due to irresponsibility. “I would like to ask the government to take stringent measures against the vice and I call on my fellow MPs to work together … many things have gone astray because of politicians. It’s high time we supported the government in protecting our resource,” said Mr Bilakwate. Kiteto legislator Emmanueli Papian pointed out that he was confident the problem will be addressed and the national status restored based on the government’s firmness on the issue. Mr Papian asked the ministry to publicly issue the list of leaders involved in the matter, saying the strategy will help to identify leaders sabotaging the nation. He cited Uganda as a testimony, saying the East African nation has recorded great achievements in the fight against illegal fishing because of the government’s efforts. “Uganda has set strict laws, which have effectively helped to overcome the problem, it’s my belief that the government’s initiatives will assist Tanzania to restore its status,” he observed. Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture, Livestock and Water, Mahmoud Mgimwa, assured the minister, Mr Luhaga Mpina of support in the fight against the vice.
