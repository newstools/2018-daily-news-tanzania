The observation was made here yesterday in the Parliament by the Prime Minister, Mr Kassim Majaliwa, advising that the preparations should include the stakeholders’ meeting and coming up with a system that would control the auctioning so its farmers get the best prices. He said regional and district commissioners in simsim cultivating areas should come up with various means to ensure that the auctioning is done at once. Mr Majaliwa was responding to Mr Vedasto Ngombale (Kilwa-North-CCM), in his question on when the crop buying season will start, after a stock being in place from the recent harvest and the government procedure on its sales. “ The Ministry of Agriculture is coordinating the process of buying simsim this season in collaboration with regional and district commissioners in respective areas so that the crop is sold through auctioning in this season,” pointed out the Premier. He said in future, the government will look into the possibility of including it in the ‘warehouse receipt system’ as it is the case with other related cash crops. As for coffee, Mr Majaliwa said they will meet with stakeholders in May 20th, this year, to discuss on ‘indicative prices’ before they are announced. “All regions’ cooperative leaders and farmers representatives in all coffee growing regions will meet to discuss ‘cost indicated,’ taking into consideration the prices in the world market so that we come up with indicative prices,” he further said.However, he said, the dealers will be required to buy the crop through the cooperatives. Meanwhile, the Premier has hinted that all District Commissioners (DCs) and District Executive Directors (DEDs) will be evaluated on their performances on an appraisal criteria meant to monitor, control and improve services deliveries in their midst.
