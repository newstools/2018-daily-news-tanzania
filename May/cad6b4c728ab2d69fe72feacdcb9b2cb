The NSSF Manager Temeke Mr James Oigo said the objective of meeting the employers is to identify challenges that hinder them paying employees contributions on time. “Most institutions and companies have been experiencing difficulties in operations that affect payment of employees’ monthly contributions to NSSF,” he said at the seminar to employers in Ilala District held in Dar es Salaam over the weekend. He added, “From next week we start visiting employers in their work places to know how they pay the accumulations of the workers’ pension contributions and identify challenges hampering smooth payment,” He said last week they published in the newspapers the names of bad debtors in a bid to push employers pay pension contributions on time. He said those who will fail to pay pension contributions even after the publications of the names will be prosecuted. “Going to court is the last resort. We would like to solve all the challenges and problems outside the court because it may create unhealthy relations between employers and employees,” he said.
