The order has come timely and the new leadership is required to improve its source of revenues, while new sources of income should be established. For many years NSC has relied on 10 per cent accrued from gate revenue during matches as its source of revenue and recently collection of returns from National Gaming Board. The new order if well implemented it will enable NSC to mobilize resources from government as well as non-government organizations and individuals to provide required support for promotion of specific sports disciplines. As well, it was good to see that the Minister has seen something wrong in NSC law when ordered the new leadership to make revision of the law that established the body in order to do away with outdated laws. Its well known that NSC whose functions are to develop, promote and control all forms of amateur sports on a national basis, was established by the Parliament Act of 1967. To make it function as an organ that govern sports to suit technological word, the the new leadership is therefore required to provide among others training of staff, aid to national associations or organisations, playing fields and other facilities, sports equipment and other sports items as may be necessary and the accelerated development of sports. While we congratulate Tenga and his team mates for the honour given to them by Tanzanians, we see as well a tough job ahead of them. Among them are to organise, in consultation with the national associations, national, international and other sports competitions and festivals as a means of exchanging experience and fostering friendly relations with other nations, to stimulate general interest in all sports by their organisation at all levels and to plan a general policy of sports promotion.
