For us here, it is a public holiday. But it is also an opportunity to reflect on the concrete situation on the ground on the condition of workers both in the public and private sectors at national level. In doing so, the state of the national economy should be the focus: how are we fairing today, how did we fair up at the launch of this country’s independence especially when we embarked on the socialist road of development during the reign of the founder President and Father of the Nation, Mwalimu Julius Kambarage Nyerere? How are we fairing today? People reading this column will agree that we have a serious problem: almost every household has young people, albeit educated, who are jobless, looking for jobs, which are nowhere to be found! And those jobs available in either the public or private sectors are surrounded by a serious phenomenon. We will come back to this factor later in the course of this perspective, which is aimed at calling upon the Magufuli Administration to revive and strengthen the public sector in the economic stream of this country. In arguing the thesis for a stronger public sector, let us make a flashback on what happened to this country in the maiden Mwalimu Nyerere administration in the midseventies and eighties. Those who were around during those days, including myself will coincide the point that school leavers those days were actually assigned jobs right from college graduation either in public services or factories around those days. We had an emerging industrial economy without singing and dancing about itas could be seen with the blossoming textile factories then including leather ones. Hence Friendship, Mwatex, Sunguratex, Kiltex and so forth in various spots of our country fed from our own home grown cotton. I have forgotten what we did with our sisal then, as we equally grew it in abundance. But the industrial agenda was there from the word go! Actually, I remember those days when most of our people especially our women had immensely adored our own home made dresses made from our own cotton such as “kanga” and “vitenge” –we even had shirts made from our own textile factories. We had no trouble searching for our country’s national dresses –as they were there – without anyone declaring them as much! Most of our leaders were happy and comfortable with home grown “vitenge” shirts and anyone wearing western full-suits was looked at suspiciously, as is he was an alien! [Hahahahahah!] This is just one line of our industrial initiative then. We had others– when we had to do something about our abundant leather given the fact that our people have domestic animals in abundance. So really the industrial initiative was there from the word go – a few years after our independence. Had it not been for the war brought about by the invasion and occupation of parts of our country by the then military dictator Iddi Amin of neighboring Uganda, which had obliged us to empty our national treasury to fight off the invasion, we would have been very far in terms of both agricultural and industrial development. Given this downfall, successive post Mwalimu Nyerere administrations had difficulty to recoup the industrial initiative because of western donor countries pressures to undo the socialist agenda which essentially prioritized the public sector–or a higher stake ownership of factories and industries and other enterprises then in state or public hands. But successive administrations also lacked the courage to recoup the lost initiative of founder President Mwalimu Nyerere in favor of the predominance of the public sector in the national economy of the country. Instead, an economic motto arose to the effect that privatization was the “engine of economic growth”. But the nature and characteristics of privatization was not appreciated then–as goes the logic of private capital: the fewer the workers, the better. Under privatization, there is no humane honor for workers also as they are recruited by a wave of hands and as they are dismissed by equally the wave of hands of the owner of a given private enterprise! Good Lord! Now where do we stand today? Clearly this is a huge question. As pointed out earlier at the launch of this perspective, we seem to have thousands of jobless young people. To my mind, the reason is the loss of the earlier initiative by our founder President in favor of the public sector as the engine of our national economy. Fortunately, we have a new leader, Dr John Magufuli who is clearly courageous -as he has shown of late to put a halt to the looting of our mineral wealth- which were being shipped out of the country with wanton abandon . But the question now is: what is the road forward? Again as he has shown courage in ensuring that our national Airline, Air Tanzania does not die, he needs to be advised to continue the courage to revive the public sector which is either dying or has been played down. We need the creation of public or state owned enterprises of our well-known strategic natural resources such as minerals and others, going in partnership in terms of equity shares by foreign firms wishing to come along as “investors”. It is one thing to invite investors to come along as partners with the public sector as represented by state institutions, it is another for them to come along as “win all and take all”! No! By reviving the public sector, workers in this country at all levels will be assured, not only of their job security but their honor as nationals of this country. In a public sector, as we have all experienced here hitherto, one is recruited by a formal letter of appointment, indicating probation period and permanence. The opposite is the case with the private sector–one is recruited by a wave of hands to “sit there” as one is fired by the same wave of hands to “get out”, to use polite language! Oh! No! ● makwaia@spicenet.co.tz
