UDOM Vice-Chancellor (VC), Prof Egid Mubofu noted here over the weekend that the public lecture, to take place at the university’s famous Chimwaga Hall, will mark the inauguration of the Mwalimu Julius Nyerere Annual Memorial Lecture Series. “I appeal to all members of UDOM community and the general public to attend this prestigious and historic event,” said the VC. Prof Mubofu said UDOM will be conducting annual lecture series in honour of Mwalimu Julius Nyerere in order to recognise the key role which the country’s founding President played in education development. He further noted that UDOM has started to conduct researches on the state of education in the country, in the wake of the call issued by former President and UDOM Chancellor, Mr Benjamin Mkapa in March. Prof Mubofu said the university will embark on debates on the state of education after finalising the researches, to respond to the call issued by its Chancellor, saying the studies would provide scholars with facts on the subject. “We will invite members of the public from all walks of life to attend the debates on state of education,” said the VC. Speaking at UDOM Vice Chancellor investiture ceremony in March, Mr Mkapa, observed that it was vital to convene a national debate on the state of education, following public schools’ poor performance in national examinations. The UDOM Chancellor said the national debate should also involve people from all walks of life, to seek the root cause of the public schools to perform poorly in the examinations.
