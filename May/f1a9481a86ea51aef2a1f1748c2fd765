In addition to scooping the Manufacturer of the Year title, TBL Group bagged another trophy - The Beverage Manufacturer Award in the Large Industries Category. Speaking at the awards presentation ceremony over the weekend, TBL Group Managing Director and AB InBev’s East Africa Business Unit President, Roberto Jarrin said, the company had continuously proven that world class manufacturing processes were possible in Tanzania. “That is why our Mbeya, Mwanza and Dar es Salaam breweries consistently rank among the best in Africa and the world. In addition to our focus on quality products, we take great responsibility in supporting the agriculture sector by working with agricultural experts, entrepreneurs and engineers to create innovative solutions with the intention to support our local small scale farmers by merging technology and agriculture,” he said. Across the spectrum, TBL is renowned for being truly Tanzanian for its use of locally-sourced brewing ingredients and award-winning local brands that are the nation’s best-loved beers. The company which is both a top manufacturer and employer in Tanzania, has invested significantly in world class manufacturing processes, its people and empowered its entire supply chain. TBL is the nation’s oldest and number one brewer in the country. The Group’s contribution to the development of Tanzania through the collection and payment of taxes, as well as community based initiatives, continues to be recognised by various stakeholders in the country through the various accolades accorded to the company, he said. TBL is the oldest and largest brewing company in Tanzania. It produces, distributes, and sells malt beer, non-alcoholic malt beverages, and alcoholic fruit beverages in Tanzania. It is listed on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange and is a subsidiary of SABMiller, a multinational brewing and beverage company that has been acquired by Anheuser-Busch InBev in 2016.
