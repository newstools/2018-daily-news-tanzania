Mr Ulega made the remarks when he toured the Arusha-based Sunflag plant and found a big stock of fishing nets even as fishermen face artificial shortages. He also found out that indicative prices differed greatly in comparison to actual prices in the market; while the industry indicates the nets for small fish should be sold at 21,200/-, the Minister said the same were being sold at between 150,000/- and 200,000/- across the Lake Zone. Apparently, that’s why he made an impromptu visit at the Arusha plant to find out the reason behind Sunflag’s failure to produce enough nets to satisfy the market, only to learn a different story altogether. “… available reports show you have failed to produce enough nets … I’ve also learnt that fishermen are having a lot of trouble sourcing these nets … so I decided to come here as a means to establishing the truth and charting the way forward,” he said. The Sunflag Administration Manager, Mr Magesa Mgunda told the Minister that the plant had such a huge stock of the nets that they had since decided to stop production temporarily -- and that some clients had ordered nets but had not called to collect them. Mr Mgunda thanked the government for the trust it put in the industry and issuing it with a permit to produce the nets, but expressed concern that they were facing a lot of market challenges, alluding to some ‘dirty game.’ He added that some of their detractors were currently circulating ‘information’ that the quality of the nets was poor, which he said wasn’t true. He said some had since begun importing nets while the country has enough from the local industry. The Minister pledged to make a further follow-up and take necessary measures to ensure local industries were protected.
