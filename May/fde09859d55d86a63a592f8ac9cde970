Dr Mahenge issued the directive here during a recent Regional Consultative Council (RCC) meeting, pointing out that the government’s decision to shift to the Central Zone region had created a number of opportunities. “The executive should now undertake the role to mobilize groups of people, largely women and youngsters to grab business opportunities,” the RC said while opening the RCC meeting. The meeting brought together executives and Members of Parliament in the region to deliberate on issues pertaining to development particularly projects and regional budget. Dr Mahenge further ordered regional executives to identify likely business opportunities in the construction of Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) and Hoima-Tanga Oil Pipeline in order to prepare youth and women to grab them. “While youth will provide the projects with workforce, women can benefit from selling food to the labourers in the projects,” he observed. The Hoima-Tanga Pipeline, which will pass through Kondoa District, is set to create a number opportunities including employment and business to residents of Dodoma. Dr Mahenge informed the RCC meeting that every council earmarks ten percent of the budget to empower youth and women economically and that the executives can help the groups to develop business proposals in connection to the ongoing development projects. He explained that the special programme to empower women and youth was introduced by the government to enable the groups engage income generating activities, which would also create employment to members of the public.
