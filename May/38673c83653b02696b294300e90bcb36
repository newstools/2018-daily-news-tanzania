The Minister for Water and Irrigation, Eng Isack Kamwelwe told the National Assembly yesterday that after the successful implementation of phase II of the project, the government will move on to implement the third phase that will make water services available to Ilemela, Katoro, Buselesele, Mbogwe, Geita and Msalala. “This will ensure increase of water supply in areas where the current water production does not meet the demand,” he said. Josephine Tabitha Chagula (Special Seats, CCM), had told parliamentarians that water production in the new region currently stands at 4 million litres a day while the actual demand was 15 million litres. “I think that there is a need to extend the Lake Victoria project to improve supply in Geita and its environs,” she said. Apparently, the lawmaker said Nyang’hwale District had one of the best water projects that could have eased access to water in the area; however, the project remains dormant for the past six years. Responding, Eng. Kamwelwe said a contractor implementing the Nyang’hwale water project was now on site, calling on wananchi to calm down as the government moves to address the problem. Earlier, Deputy Minister for Water and Irrigation, Mr Jumaa Aweso said the government was implementing the Water Sector Development Programme (WSDP II) that target on improving water access in remote areas. Mr Aweso noted that as of April 2018, the government had completed 66 projects in 217 villages in Geita region covering Bukombe, Chato, Mbogwe and Nyang’hwale districts. “This is the project that has benefited at least 14,300 people in Geita,” he said. Meanwhile, the deputy minister said the government was considering implementing the first phase of water distribution network in Kigamboni and Temeke districts in Dar es Salaam, targeting to fully use the available water at the Kimbiji and Mpera deep boreholes.
