Her nomination was announced before the National Assembly, here yesterday, by the Chairperson of the House, Mr Andrew Chenge, after the question and answer session, when reading an announcement from Speaker Job Ndugai regarding the matter. Mr Chenge told parliamentarians that the MP for Handeni Rural under the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) was elected to the presidency during the ongoing PAP meeting in Midrand in South Africa. Ms Mhita, he disclosed, won the post during an election session held on May 14, 2018, after defeating a Chadian MP, who was seeking re-election. The new president, according to Mr Chenge, will hold the post for three years effective from now. “On your behalf, I take this opportunity to congratulate Honourable Mboni Mhita for this honour, not only to this Parliament but also to the nation as a whole. In addition, we wish her well when discharging her new duties,” he said while quoting the Speaker’s announcement. The Pan-African Parliament (PAP), also known as the African Parliament, is the legislative body of the African Union and held its inaugural session in March 2004.
