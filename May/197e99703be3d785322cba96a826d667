Addressing NAOT workers’ council meeting here yesterday, Dr Ndumbaro said NAOT has helped the government to curb loss of public funds in its authorities and agencies, saying the development also saw the increase of revenue collections. “We’ve witnessed major improvements in public institutions in the wake of execution of recommendations, which were issued by NAOT,” said the PS. The NAOT workers’ council meeting, which is convened to respond the government’s circular no 1 of 1970, brought together 99 workers to discuss operations of the office for the upcoming financial year. Dr Ndumbaro noted that the government will continue to accord maximum cooperation to NAOT to enable the office to attain goals set by the government in good management of resources. The Controller and Auditor General (CAG), Prof Mussa Assad, informed that NAOT emerged best Audit agency in Africa for three consecutive years in 2014 and 2015 and 2017 and that he was optimistic that the office would also register such achievement this year. “We’ve managed to issue our reports timely after every March 30 annually and issue recommendations to the government,” observed the CAG. Prof Assad said among the achievements registered by NAOT was to efficiently conduct audit for United Nations (UN) after taking over from China, pointing out NAOT will next month hand over the role to Chile. However, Prof Assad noted that meagre budget was a challenge for NAOT to execute emergence responsibilities such as special audit to government authorities and public institutions as directed by the government. “NAOT is also facing shortage of working tools such as vehicles and laptops to enable its officers compile reports,” he said.
