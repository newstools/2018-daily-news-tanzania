Titled "2018 Standard Charted Cup Tournament" the competition will take place on June 23, this year, whereby the winner will get the grand prize of a trip to Liverpool Football Club Anfield, UK. The Standard Chartered Group is the main sponsor of the Liverpool Football Club from 2010 to 2018/19. According to the Bank's Chief Executive Officer, Mr Sanjay Rughan, the Standard Chartered has organized the tournament to give football fans an opportunity to actively engage in developing football. "This year the tournament will be slightly different. We will only have the local tournament and the winner out of 32 teams will win the grand price of a once in a lifetime 'money can't buy' opportunity if visiting and watching a live match at an English Premiere League football pitch," he said, adding that: “The move will ensure Tanzanians are guaranteed to enjoy the Liverpool experience should they win in the country.”
