He said that the government is aware of the need for repair of the housing estate which was built by the founding father of Zanzibar, the late Sheikh Abeid Karume, including the Micheweni flats. The deputy minister admitted before the House that most of the housing units were in bad condition and thus a need for renovation since the structures are becoming an inconvenience to occupants. “Insufficient funds hampers repairs, as only 8.8m/= has been collected from rent since the Zanzibar Housing Corporation (ZHC) was established recently. Mr. Juma’s statement was in response to questions asked by a backbencher, Mr. Ali Khamis Bakar (CCM- Tumbe), who wanted to know why the dilapidated flats of Micheweni have not been repaired for long.
