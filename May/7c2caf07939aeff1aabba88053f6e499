This was said by Musoma District Commissioner (DC) Dr. Vincent Naano during commemoration of Press Freedom Day at Mativila beach in Musoma municipality. "From now on, it is prohibited for any public institutions in Mara region to invite only Television reporters only for this does not only entertain division among journalists but it also denies citizens of the right to get information," said DC Naano who represented Mara Regional Commissioner. He elaborated that televisions in the country are accessed by a few elites as the source of information while majority of the citizens depend on radio and other means including newspapers. The DC clarified that at any event where television reporters are invited for getting news, there must be also radio and Newspaper reporters. He thanked Journalists for working as a connecting tool between government and citizens in the region and that the cooperation will be highly strengthened as an important step to realise the fifth phase government dream of industrialization.
