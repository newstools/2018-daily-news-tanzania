The RC made the observation while presiding over a ceremony to handover 60 desks to Mwenge Primary School by NMB Bank on Monday, adding that the piece of land does not expand, but the number of pupils enrolling in such institutions is increasing. He said that since the school lacks adequate land for expansion, it was high time for authorities in the area considered erecting storey buildings to keep pace with the increasing number of pupils it accommodates. Earlier, the School Committee members had complained to the authority that the number of pupils in the area was ballooning, but the classrooms were not being built because of the tiny space they have. On his side, Mwenge Primary School head teacher Mapambano Petro pointed out that the institution was built in 1974, current hosts 1,300 pupils with each classroom accommodating about 200 pupils. He informed the RC that the school also faces a serious shortage of staff rooms as offices for the teachers, besides the classrooms. Speaking at the occasion, the NMB Manager for Lake Zone, Mr Abraham Augustino hinted that his institution has set aside 11bn/- in its Social Corporate Responsibilities to support such facilities in the communities countrywide. In the ceremony, the bank also donated desks worth 5m/- and some medical supplies of the same amount to Pasiansi Primary School. The medical supplies included four Hospital ward-beds, two delivery beds and two BP machines.
