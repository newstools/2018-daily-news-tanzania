Launching the two first degree courses in Secretarial Studies and Administration and Record Management, Archives and Information Management over the weekend – now on offer at the TPSC -- he underlined the importance of better service provision from the government institutions. He said the government has been improving the standards of the college to make it serve the public servants better. “Regardless of their (civil servants’) educational background or CV (curriculum vitae), they must come at this college to be ‘brushed up’ and taught how to serve the people as civil servants,” he added. Reporting to the president, he said he warned the senior officials at the public sector for not adhering to his call. The minister applauded the college management for their tireless effort toward attaining their goal of launching the courses. Earlier, the college Rector and CEO, Dr Henry Mambo, said they had ‘achieved a lot’ in training its employees in various disciplines. He said the new courses started in October last year and that of its crop of 123 students, 19 were taking Secretarial Studies and Administration while 104 were studying Records Management, Archives and Information Management. Dr Mambo who is also a seasonal lecturer in Public Service in the country, said that his college has applied for the recognition by the Tanzania Commission for Universities (TCU) to enable majority Tanzanians access the courses. “By doing so we believe many Tanzanians will access this course,” he noted. He revealed that the two degree courses were also registered with The National Council for Technical Education (NACTE). “In that case graduates of this course can be able to work here in Tanzania and outside the country,” Dr Mambo said. The college has six branches in Dar es Salaam, Tabora, Tanga, Singida, Mtwara and Mbeya
