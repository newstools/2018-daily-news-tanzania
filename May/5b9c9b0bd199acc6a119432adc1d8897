He pointed out here yesterday that many areas in Unguja and Pemba have been affected by the recent floods as well as by rising seas, but they have delayed to take appropriate measures because they lack funds. “ We expected to receive about 800m/- from the ‘African Development Bank (AfDB) in the ending 2017/2018 fiscal year, but unfortunately the money was not there. We expect to get it this year (2018/2019) to control floods in the worst affected areas like Msuka village in Pemba,” added N’hunga. His statement was in response to concerns raised on the effects of ‘climate change’ in the Islands by Mr Omar Seif Abeid (CCM-Konde), who said Msuka area, where the Coastal Security Guard Forces (KMKM) barracks are also located, was at the risk being washed away. Mr N’Hunga said while the government was waiting for the funds from AfDB, his office has been working with the Zanzibar Environment Management Authority (ZEMA) to pile stones and build a temporary flood control barriers. He said in efforts to minimise impacts of floods in the Islands, the citizens should be reminded on the importance of Climate Change mitigation and adaptation measures to remain safe.
