Manager of the Radio Station, Mr Tatenda Nyawo, said here yesterday that the exhibition will provide builders with a platform to showcase their products and services, pointing out among the products as building materials, furniture and gardening tools. “This will provide the city dwellers with an opportunity for shopping and receiving knowledge on building and construction,” said the Radio Station Manager. Mr Nyawo appealed to construction stakeholders to start booking for a place in the two-day annual event. Co-coordinator of the exhibition, Mr Victor Simon said Dodoma has a good number of professional masons and plumbers, but they were facing a challenge of unemployment due to most construction firms using workforce from other regions. He noted that the exhibition was thus aimed at introducing the workforce to construction companies, to make use of them while carrying out construction projects in Dodoma. Mr Simon said the exhibition will bring together building material shop owners and construction firms hence to address the issue of delays in payment of building materials. “ The long delay of building materials payment poses a serious challenge for business growth,” he observed. The Dodoma City Council Director, Mr Godwin Kunambi, said the relocation of the government to Dodoma has provided an opportunity to the construction firms, urging them to make use of the exhibition to promote their services. “This is a great opportunity for the building materials traders to promote their products and services to people and institutions putting up their buildings in the Capital City,” he said.
