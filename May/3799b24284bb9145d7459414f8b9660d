Mr. Suleiman Sarahan Said (CCM- Chakechake) said that, “lack of public toilets in public areas like Chakechake Town including market areas is an embarrassment to the islands regarded as a place of civilized people.” In response to the concerns, the Minister of State- (Regional Administration, local Government and Special Department), Mr. Shamata Shaame Khamis, refuted claims by the representative, maintaining that the facilities are present at Chakechake, Tibirinzi and Machomanne markets. “Plans are also underway to ensure all public areas in the Islands have public toilets along with improving other essentials facilities,” Mr. Khamis told the House during questions and answer session on the first day of the 2018/2019 budget session.
