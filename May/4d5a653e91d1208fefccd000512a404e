Acting Director of the Institute, Dr Kassim Nihuka made the revelation in Dar es Salaam over the weekend, noting that the plan is scheduled to start in July this year. “In order to ensure the plan is well managed, the institute will use our students in our Morogoro, Dar es Salaam and Mwanza-based Luchelele campuses,” said Dr Nihuka, adding that the institute will use youth willing to volunteer. He expressed the need for youth ready to volunteer to come out and support in the training and other activities in the new centres yet to be opened. Dr Nihuka said the set-up plan aims at helping and supplementing the government’s efforts to improve education in the country. He was speaking during a two-day meeting of the Workers’ Council at the Institute. On the other hand, Dr Nihuka said the institute will continue to improve its learning environment and activities to ensure they provide quality education to the people in need. “We are doing all the best to ensure provision of the best and required trainings to the needy...one of the activities we are doing is to ensure regular visits to compasses, providing them with the necessities,” he said. Officiating at the event, the Dar es Salaam Regional Administrative Secretary, Ms Theresia Mbando commended the institute for the development plans it has set up, calling for more improvement and creation of strategies that will generate income and more revenues to the institute. “I commend you for the various strategies you are implementing for the better future of the institute and the nation but I wish to encourage you to focus on strategies of ensuring you enough revenues,” she said.
