He had come out of retirement to take on his former protege Najib Razak, who has been beset by allegations of corruption and cronyism. Mr Mahathir told reporters: "We are not seeking revenge, we want to restore the rule of law". The election commission said Mr Mahathir's opposition alliance had won 115 seats, over the threshold of 112 seats needed to form a government. He said he hoped a swearing-in ceremony would be held on Thursday. Mr Mahathir will become the oldest elected leader in the world.
