Dr Mahenge hinted that here recently in a press conference, saying that he was quite determined to see into it that many small-scale industries flourish in the region. “Land should not be a barrier for establishment of diverse industries in my region. I am contemplating over holding a meeting with relevant stakeholders and Dodoma City Council on that,” he said. Reports suggest that most investors of small-scale sunflower industries in the region can not acquire pieces of land to establish their factories in the region because of high prices tied on them by the City Council for any business. According to a recent survey conducted by BEST-Dialogue in Tanzania in consultations with some experts from Morogoro based Mzumbe University, most factories in the Central Zone Region are operating their businesses in residential areas, basically because they lack ‘financial powers’ to buy/hire such pieces of land. BEST-Dialogue (formerly known as BEST-AC) is a programme that facilitates local organisations in the business sector to organise training and carry out research in business sector. Last week, Regional Executive Secretary with the Tanzania Chamber for Commerce Industrial and Agriculture (TCCIA), Mr Idd Senge underscored the need for the authorities in the region to come up with a special strategy that would enable local investors to invest largely in diverse small scale industries. He observed that, business capital of most indigenous small scale industry proprietors ranges from 2m/- to 10m/-, and that is not enough to purchase a piece of land in the ‘high-going-plots.
