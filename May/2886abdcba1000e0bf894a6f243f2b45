This was revealed by Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa in Parliament, yesterday, when responding to on the spot question posed by Maulid Mtulia (Kinondoni-CCM) on measures the government is taking to improve and easy transport woes facing Dar es Salaam residents. But, the Prime Minister was quick to warn that the government would not hesitate to scrap the contract with the current operator should it be proven beyond reasonable doubt that the company has failed to deliver to the government’s expectations. He said that they have decided to contract another investor to bring in new buses and join the deal, to make the whole business competitive rather than a monopoly and address the challenges. “ We are trying to sort out the challenges of Udart that is why we have commissioned another investor to bring in buses for the transport operations, to make it more competitive,” said the Premier. However, he said, in most cases an entity being run by two administrators, in house misunderstandings are common, saying the government, which is a shareholder in the business, is ensuring all is under control. The Premier told the Parliament that the government is working around the clock to improve transport services and infrastructure so that the intended goals are attained. Mr Majaliwa said the government is aware of infrastructure hassle facing the project, especially during the rainy season saying they are working for a lasting solution. It has increasingly become clear that the current fleet of the Dar Rapid Transit (Dart)’s modern blue buses is not enough for the thousands of commuters. City commuters have to contend with the congestion at the Udart bus stations for longer especially during rush hours where thousands throng the stations as the fleet of buses in not enough. During the heavy rains, it is an order of the day for Udart buses to suspend operations following floods at Jangwani valley.
