The remark was made here by the Director of Forest and Beekeeping in the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism, Dr Ezekiel Mwakalukwa, recently in a beekeeping stakeholders meeting, adding that the government has formed a ten-member team to develop the programme. “ I appeal to beekeeping stakeholders to accord them maximum cooperation once they kick off with their duties to collect views for the programme,” he said. Dr Mwakalukwa hinted that the envisioned programme would facilitate and improve honey production in the country. According to Director, the country has potential untapped areas where beekeeping can still flourish in several forests, saying: “Tanzania is endowed with 48.1 millon hectares of forest reserves which is equivalent to 54.4 percent of all the country’s land.” Dr Mwakalukwa said while 38 percent of the forest was under protected area, 57 percent of the forest reserve was not in the protected area, adding that six percent of the forest was in the National Parks, Game reserves and Game Controlled areas. He noted that the government through Tanzania Forest Services Agency (TFS) has set up 11 Bee Keeping Reserves in various parts of the country, besides 14 other centres which have been set up by the local government authorities. “ We came up with the idea to set up the Bee Keeping Reserves after realizing that there was a growing trend of deforestation in the country as a result of some human activities,” he further said.
