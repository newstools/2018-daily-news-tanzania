He told the `Daily News' yesterday that the meeting is scheduled for next week to chart the way forward for operations of the first commodity market in the country which is expected to begin with sesame oil. “Meeting key stakeholders in the sesame production is important in charting the best way for smooth business operations,” he said in a telephone interview from Dodoma. He said an official date for starting TMX operations will be set by the government after the meeting with key stakeholders in the sesame production. Mr Malekano said the harvest seasons have commenced in Mtwara, Lindi and Morogoro regions and will be followed by Ruvuma, Coast, Tanga, Rukwa and Mbeya. TMX is a multi-commodity exchange that would create orderly, transparent and ready market for agricultural commodities and precious metals, as well as improved agricultural production that would help create more opportunities for investment in the country’s economy. A team of experts have been dispatched to major cotton-growing areas in the country to assess the feasibility for smooth implementation of the exchange where contract farming and warehouse receipt system are practiced. Similarly in the cashew nut producing regions, an assessment will be carried to smooth operations of the mercantile market to benefit farmers in terms of better prices.
