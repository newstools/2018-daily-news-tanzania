The Deputy Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Education, Science, Technology and Vocational Training, Prof James Mdoe told journalists over the weekend on the sidelines of a forum to discuss youth capacity building that there would be no need for investors to acquire staff from abroad. The forum, sponsored by the Tanzania Private Sector Foundation (TPSF), brought together several stakeholders from private and public sectors who discussed among other things, the need to form sectorial councils to advise the government on the components that needs to be featured in the trainings in question. “The monies we borrowed from the WB will be acquired in the same style like that of higher education. The beneficiaries will be youths in colleges in the lower levels and those trained in short courses. The needs of investors will detect our priority in issuing loans and the courses of preference,” Prof Mdoe said. He pointed that through sectorial councils, the government in some point recall already graduated youths and support them to go for special trainings that meet the needs of investors. Prof Mdoe said the loan has been acquired for the purposes of facilitating the implementation of a five-year project dubbed ‘Education and skills for productive jobs’ which started last year. He said that the project is being implemented by the ministry in collaboration with National Council for Technical Education (NACTE), Vocational Education and Training Authority (VETA), Higher Education Students’ Loans Board (HESLB) and Tanzania Commission for Universities (TCU) among others. The TPSF Executive Director, Mr Godfrey Simbeye, said the move by the government to invest in producing skillful youths in the industrial sector was commendable and the private sector gives priority on youth training.
