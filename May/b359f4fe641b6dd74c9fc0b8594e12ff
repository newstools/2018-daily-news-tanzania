Though the prosecution had supported the appeal on grounds that the evidence Shabani, the appellant, had tendered was not considered by the trial court, Justices Bernard Luanda, Batuel Mmilla and Gerald Ndika found the prosecution had fully established its case. Even after the panel had expunged from record the evidence of the victim after the trial court failed to take required legal procedure before receiving her evidence, they found availability of “overwhelming evidence” that supported the appellant’s conviction of rape. “ … the appeal is devoid of any merit. The same is dismissed in its entirety,” declared the justices of the appellate court, the highest temple of justice in the country. They noted that indeed the District Court of Mpanda had not ‘at all’ considered the appellant’s defence that he did not commit the offence. However, the justices noted that further from the record that the High Court, when considering the appellant’s first appeal, stepped into the shoes of the trial court and considered his defence vis-à-vis the prosecution and later came to the conclusion that it does not shake the prosecution’s case. Referring to various previous decided cases, the panel concurred that what the High Court did was within its powers because one of functions of a higher court on appeal is to re-appraise the entire evidence on record with a view to seeing whether justice prevailed. The justices also rejected another ground of appeal that the witnesses who supported his conviction were not credible and that the prosecution had not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt to the required standard as needed in criminal trials.
