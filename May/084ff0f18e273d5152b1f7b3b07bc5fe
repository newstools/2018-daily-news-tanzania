Speaking to students at the University of Dodoma (UDOM) over the weekend, Communications Officer from TIRA, Mr Phostine Uyuke said members of the public can conduct a quick verification of vehicle insurance through TIRA-MIS application downloaded on smart phones. “The system was introduced to help insurance customers to establish if a vehicle insurance cover note was genuine before purchasing it, but any person can download and use the application through smart phones or computer,” said the TIRA Communications Officer at a meeting with students. The meeting was part of ongoing campaign carried out jointly by TIRA and Office of Tanzania Insurance Ombudsman which aims at raising awareness on importance of insurance in various services. Mr Oyuke pointed out that many people have been using such means of transport without conducting any verification of vehicle insurances to be assured of financial protection in case of physical damage caused by road accident. “Any person has a role to conduct verification of vehicle insurance before beginning a journey by bus or even bodaboda, to be assured of financial protection in case of physical damage caused by road accidents,” he observed. A Senior Officer from Tanzania Insurance Ombudsman, Mr Aderickson Njunwa, said members of the public can lodge a complaint to Ombudsman Office in case of dissatisfaction in insurance services. He explained that an insurance firm should pay compensation to a victim of road accident within 45 days and that the victim should keep receipts of medication to claim compensation from insurance firms. “An insurance firm will make payment to a victim of road accident after the victim submits the receipts of medication to insurance firm office within 45 days,” he said.
