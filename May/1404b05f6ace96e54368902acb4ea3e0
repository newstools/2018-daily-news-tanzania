â€œWith this e-sea vessel registration, definitely our trust internationally will rise as it will help us be open and careful when issuing licences to international ships, Mr Haroun Ali Suleiman, the minister responsible for legal affairs, said at the launch of the new technology. Mr Suleiman graced the event held here on behalf of the Second Vice President, Ambassador Seif Ali Iddi, who thanked the South Korean government for supporting the establishment of the online ship registration. The minister said there had been complaints that sea vessel registration in Zanzibar was unreliable after a number of international ships registered by the Zanzibar Maritime Authority (ZMA) and flying the Tanzania flag, were implicated in crimes that included transportation of illicit drugs and arms. After the incidents, the Union government intervened by imposing a temporary ban on ZMA to register foreign vessels pending reforms or improvement of sea vessels registration. Negotiations are underway between Zanzibar authorities and their Union government counterparts to lift the ban after major reforms in the registration process. The Deputy Minister for Infrastructure, Communication and Transport, Mr Mohammed Ahmada Salum, said e-sea vessel registration would help in monitoring ships and take action against vessels violating International Maritime Organisations (IMO) regulations.
