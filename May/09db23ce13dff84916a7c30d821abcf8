Six people have lost their lives so far, as waterborne diseases have hit the Longido and the District Commissioner, Mr Daniel Chongolo is now ordering thorough steps to be taken in effort to contain the outbreaks in the area. “The first step is to ensure that every household has toilet facilities and actually use them; many of the residents in Longido do not have latrines and attend their calls of nature in bushes, valleys and other open spaces,” pointed out Mr Chongolo. Mr Chongolo said that there are some houses with toilets that are never used. “People build toilets and then lock them up. Some have been locked up for 15 years,” he said, adding that these were used only when health officers conducted inspections; otherwise they still use bushes. The District Commissioner was addressing councillors during the ‘monthly full council meeting sessions, where he ordered that owners of houses without toilets or latrines should be arrested and charged. During the meeting, various ward leaders said the dis-eases became worse due to the fact that, people did not know what was affecting them when they were affected by diarrhoea and vomiting. It was later realized that the villagers were consuming water contaminated with human faeces due to limited number of latrines in local households. Heavy rains have been sweeping contaminants into rivers and wells used by residents for drinking. A special cholera treatment camp has been established in the district, based In the hardest hit ‘Olgilaimerigoi’ Ward where a team of medical officers are currently busy treating the victims. Still the actual number of cholera victims is yet to be officially confirmed as officials are combing down the area, inspecting households and people who could be affected. The mostly Maasai pastoralists in Longido do not have toilets in their households and the fact that many keep moving from one place to another with cattle, they do not see the need of having latrines wherever they go.
