And in a bid to promote the tourism industry in the bloc, regional top chiefs have been meeting to endorse a common tourist visa, which would ease marketing the region as a single travel package. This is possible because the member states have the common world’s leading tourists’ attractions of wildlife, natural resources such as rainforests, lakes and rivers, and diverse historical cultural sites, and for that matter, a single tourist visa is desirable in the region to facilitate the growth of the sector, and reduce the burden on the tourists. Tourist entry visa fees range between $50 and $100 across the region, meaning that the EAC Council of Ministers, which is the designated decision-making authority on all matters of sovereignty, revenue, policy and immigration matters, including the joint visas for the tourists, should now give the area real focus, especially now that the member states are giving priority to industrialization to stop depending on some goods they can locally manufacture. This is because the tourists can equally turn to be prospective investors and if this be would approved, a tourist will apply for one country entry visa that will be applicable in all regional member states and have an added advantage to travel through a series of endless borders to sample the unique attractions that the bloc offers. The common visa programme could help tour operators and hoteliers to plan and arrange their guests’ itineraries and packages better, and would be equally cheap for the tourist. For instance, if a tourist is in Kenya and would like to come to Uganda to do a day of rafting or bungee jumping in Jinja and go back, the only costs he will incur will be on transport and rafting and then go back saving about $50 at the border which would have been the cost of the visa. This would eliminate the idea of viewing a partner state as a competitor(s), but complementary that is why Kenya has “special arrangements” for tourists to have a multiple destination tour in East Africa by issuing them with “visitor passes” upon arrival and allows re-entry at no extra cost. Uganda is also on record as planning to scrap its visa fees after learning that a total of 3,310,065 tourists visited East Africa last year with Kenya hosting 2,001,034, Tanzania (719,031), Uganda (550,000), and Rwanda (40,000).
