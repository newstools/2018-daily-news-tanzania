It was at around 11 pm on Tuesday, last week, when armed assailants gunned down Mwadui Ward Executive Officer (WEO) Benedicto Chapewa, who was drinking at his own bar, before mutilating his body with machetes. The ward is located along the shores of Lake Rukwa in Sumbawanga District in Rukwa Region. Rukwa Regional Police Commander (RPC), George Kyando spoke to the ‘Daily News’ that the heinous crime was vengeance on part of the murderers who as per preliminary police investigations were hired from Shinyanga Region. He said the horrific and tragic incident has brought fear to residents in the ward, but denied to reveal the identities of the arrested suspects and those who are still at large. “Preliminary police investigations have uncovered that the heinous crime that sent chills in the spines of residents in the precinct and the region at large stemmed from retaliation as Chapewa was accused by several people for mistreating wananchi, by punishing them harshly when cholera hit the area, as well as soliciting and receiving bribe from pastoralists cheating them that they will be allowed to enter and graze into reserved areas Also, we have got the name of the man who masterminded the killing, though he is still at large, no stone will remain unturned until he is arrested and arraigned,” the RPC added. Mr Kyando further said that preliminary investigations show that all the four arrested suspects checked in and spent a night at a guest house owned by the late Chapewa. “On that material night while Chapewa was at his bar drinking with one of his barmaid, he was approached by an individual who was also drinking in the same bar and alerted him that he had heard two people arranging to harm him and asked him to be extra cautious. “Chapewa thanked him and gave him 2,000/- to buy himself a drink,” added the RPC.
