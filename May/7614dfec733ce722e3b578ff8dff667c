Tanzania Forest Services (TFS) Eastern Zone Acting Manager Ms Caroline Malundo said in an interview that wild animals such as antelopes and colobus monkeys were returning to the forest making it more attractive to tourists. “Destructive activities like lighting fire along forest boundaries by farmers had caused a big damage to the forest in back years, but these acts have been reduced into large extent and the forest is now appearing in a good state”, she said. Apart from contributing to nation’s income through tourism, the forest plays a very important role of regulating weather for Coast and Dar as Salaam regions. “Pugu Forest Reserve acts as “lungs” to two regions and particularly Dar es Salaam region. It absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen and thus purifies the air and minimizes the temperature”. Ms Malundo cautioned that with increasing changes in weather caused by climate change, forests like Pugu need to be protected so as to mitigate the problem. Kisarawe District Acting Forest Manager Ms Nanzia Charles said that there are a number of attractions inside the forest which attract about 1,000 tourists both foreigners and locals each year. According to her, the number of foreign tourists is bigger than that of the locals. There are 80 types of birds, 14 types of animals, and peculiar types of trees like Mnaki and Mpugupugu. The forest also offers a good viewing point to Dar es Salaam City. The forest has two camp sites and good nature trails. “There is peculiar type of small bats living in the two caves which are estimated to reach two millions in number. They have unusual habit of getting out of their caves at 6 in the morning and leaving their caves in a really amazing way return in the evening,” she said.
