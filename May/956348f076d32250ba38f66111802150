Minister of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children Ummy Mwalimu told reporters here yesterday that the government has supplied Thermal Scanners to all main gateways of the country, including border posts, airports and ports. “Thermal Scanners are devices meant to detect high body temperature as a clue for Ebola disease,” explained the Minister. Ms Mwalimu noted that the government has enhanced its integrated disease surveillance and response system in the country’s border posts that are frequently used by DRC nationals to cross into the country. She named the border posts where the government has enhanced the system as Rusumo and Mtukula in Kagera Region, Kabanga and Port of Kigoma in Lake Tanganyika. Ms Mwalimu said the government has also supplied guidelines of transportation of test samples across the country, adding that the government was supplying medical kits and drugs to all regions to prevent and treat the people in case of the disease outbreak. “ The guidelines include fact sheet of the disease that will help to easily detect a person suffering from the disease and guidelines to health service provision servants on how to take blood samplefrom the sick person and treatment,” said the minister. She said the government has already alerted all Regional Administrative Secretaries and Medical Regional Officers, saying the government has also provided senior government officials in the regions with the Fact Sheet on Ebola. Ms Mwalimu noted further that the government will closely work with the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other international organisations responsible for health as per the law to prevent the Ebola prevalence. “We have also convened an emergence meeting for our National Task Force responsible for the disease tomorrow (today),” she said. Ms Mwalimu assured the public that there was so far no any case of person with Ebola in the country, urging the people to remain watchful against the disease.
