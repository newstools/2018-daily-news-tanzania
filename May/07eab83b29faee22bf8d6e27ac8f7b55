Ms Mamboya pointed out that there have been emerging and increasing illegal financial deals in the area where the suspects use mobile phones to swindle their unsuspecting targets, adding that a case in study was her own scene. Urging the Police to spare no one in the illegal business, she said: “There are problems, I was a victim, we were questioned by the police but we have seen no action. I ask the police to take this problem seriously.” The Minister made the remark while responding to a question(s) fielded by Mr Said Omar Said (CCM-Wingwi) who raised a concern over the cybercrime, despite no one so far appearing in Court to answer such charges. The Backbencher, Said, informed the House that recently someone attempted to ‘wire out’ 9m/- from some leaders using a cellphone, but he was arrested, adding: “But we have not heard about the case again. Many people are getting problems through mobile money transaction.” However, Dr Mamboya said the Cyber Act 2015 of the union also approved by the Zanzibar House was still applicable in the area, but the Judiciary here has not started applying it as a law against cybercrimes, making it only to be recorded and heard under criminal offences procedure. She further said: “Therefore it is difficult to find statistics of the cybercrimes committed in Zanzibar.”
