During the Financial Year 2017/18, the government announced it was expanding its port in the Lake Nyasa by constructing two new gates. But Ludewa Member of Parliament, Mr Deogratias Ngalawa (CCM) says the villages at the planned site had not been compensated. The lawmaker went on to note that the feasibility study is however, “unknown” when it will be completed. “The ports on Lake Nyasa are at a longer distance from one to the other, causing serious disturbance to traders and the people,” Mr Ngalawa said. “It has posed serious challenges especially due to lack of good roads that would have simplified movement of people and goods.” The lawmaker wanted to know when the feasibility study will be complete and plans to compensate the villagers who are to pave way for the infrastructure development. Deputy Minister in charge of Works, Transport and Communication, Mr Elias Kwandikwa said the government understands the magnitude of the problem and the urgent need to construct the two gates. He said the payment to the villagers whose land will be taken for the infrastructure development will be made as soon as the funds are ready. Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA) strategy for 2017/18 includes, among other things, to construct a road and gates at the Lake Nyasa. It has already released funds for the construction of Mbamba Bay, Itungi, Kiwira, Ndumbi, Manda, Matema, Liuli, and Lupingu roads in Ludewa district. “A team of experts from the authority is conducting the preliminary studies at Nkanda, Nsele, Kyaghomi, Makonde, Yigha and the neighbouring areas to establish places to set up the gates,” he said, Adding that after the assessment the government will decide on the best spots to build a ship dock to handle boats or ship. He however, announced that the government is completing the construction of a large ship that will ply Lake Nyasa waters at the end of this month
