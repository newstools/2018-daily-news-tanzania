Morogoro Regional Commissioner (RC), Dr Kebwe Steven Kebwe, addressing a three-day workshop of the 30 newly appointed environment inspectors from Morogoro, Tanga and Coast regions, warned against arbitrary punishments on wananchi. “I do not expect you to punish people before teaching them how to protect the environment,” said the RC in a speech read on his behalf by the Regional Administrative Secretary, Mr Clifford Tandari. The three coastal regions, the RC said, were endowed with minerals, fisheries and forestry resources. Additionally, the regions are attractive to investors. However, indiscriminate economic activities that ignore environment protection are dangerous, unwelcome and must be fought, he said, adding that environment degradation is already evident in the regions. He further explained that mining without expert advice, overgrazing, encroachment on reserved land and water sources will lead to widespread poverty in the regions and elsewhere in Tanzania. Dr Kebwe challenged the officers to use the law and its regulations to protect Tanzania’s environment as the country struggles to become a middle-income nation. National Environment Management Council (NEMC) Eastern Zone Coordinator Jafar Chemgege whose office organised the workshop said the minister responsible for environment January Makamba has appointed 470 environment inspectors whom the council is training on how to carry out their duties. Morogoro Regional Environment Officer Venance Segere, one of the trainers, said there are many new areas that the inspectors have been carried through during the three-day workshop. “The training has enriched us. We are better placed to execute our duties,” he said.
