The Bank’s Board Chairman Mr Michael Shirima said here that the facility which opened its doors in the country in 2010 regards Mwanza as a potential business hub hence introducing its first branch. He said unlike other investors in the banking industry, I&M Bank was one of the few banks that sought a local partnership in Tanzania before it introduced its services. “I am proud to be part of this bank which is proudly enjoying its presence in the country and no wonder it is now here in Mwanza. As a new venture we will play our part in making sure the region is served with quality financial services,” he said. Speaking as he officiated at the opening of the new branch, the Mwanza Regional Commissioner Mr John Mongela said a lot of economic undertakings were taking place that needed more players in the financial sector. The RC mentioned some of the activities as the construction of the Mwanza Airport which will be promoted to international status upon completion and dry port in Misungwi District all set to attract many potential businesses. “This Bank comes at a time where our region is rapidly flying economically with many banking services needed as well to serve investors. My office will always be supportive to facilitate enabling environment for the businesses to grow,” he said.
